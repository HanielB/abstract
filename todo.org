* TODO Pass parameters to IDs page
:STATES:
- State "TODO"       from              [2024-01-03 Wed 13:24] \\
  So that I can define if the ids results will have available or not etc. But this will also be useful to do the search within lists from LB. The crux of the matter is that the way I filter movies now depends on how movies are in the master file. I should change things so that filtering happens on something that I get from the IDs.

    With my hosting plan this would only work via ssh. And this is quite fragile. So meh.

    To do this I'll use the MySQL remote stuff and see what I can do. It'll be necessary to create SQL commands as requests to both insert into the BD and also to select from it.

    Default can be as is, with movie cards, or could be like LB list of diary
