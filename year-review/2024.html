          <br>
          <br>

          <p>I started doing a summary of my year in movie-watching <a href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/year-review/2023.html">last year</a>, and I quite liked the experience. So here I'll summarize again some of the data analysis stuff for my movie-watching in 2024, as well as look into the films I watched that I loved the most.</p>

          <p>2024 was the 10th year since I decided to take watching films "more seriously", which amounted to log, rate, and (when I have the energy for it) write about each time I see a film. After a couple slow years (~60 films/year, although alreday above however many I was watching before), in 2017 things picked up (I saw <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2017&header=Films_watched_in_2017">198 films in 2017</a>) and have been stable ever since (an average of ~165 films/year, with a minimum of <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2021&header=Films_watched_in_2021">142 in 2021</a> and a maximum of <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2023&header=Films_watched_in_2023">204 in 2023</a>). I am happy with how this whole project took shape, because I've fallen in love with cinema in these 10 years in a way I did not anticipate. It still brings me so much joy, and there is so much to discover.</p>

          <p>Following up on 2023, 2024 was again a strong year for movie-watching for me: 189 films watched (includes rewatches), behind only 2023 and 2017, and 65 in movie theaters, behind only 2023. There were not that many great films from 2024, but in my never-ending catching up with old great films I've seen several amazing ones.</p>

          <h2>The Journey</h2>


          <p>The overview of my movie watching in 2024 is summarized in the
            plot<a class="ref" id="ref:fn1" href="#fn:1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> below. The
            green bars are for films watched in a cinema.  In the X axis by the
            names of the months are the number of watched films in that month,
            with the max and min months in bold.</p>

          <h3>Once Upon a Time in the West in a cinema</h3>

          Those close-ups on Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda on a big screen are the stuff of heaven.

          <h3>70s extravaganza</h3>

          Coppola program at Humberto Mauro kicking off with The
          Godfater, The Godfather Part II, The Conversation (missed
          Apocalypse Now, which I'd only catch up with in ...), and
          the following Monday I saw Sorcerer for the first time.

          <h3>Wuxia!</h3>

          Wuxia program at Humberto Mauro closing with Hero, one of my
          favorite films. I could not see as many as I wanted because
          of work but still caught a lot of kung-fu and had the
          amazing finish. But most importantly it was reinvigorating
          and kickstarted my return to form for watching
          <i>filminhos</i> (greatly helped by me going into vacation,
          of course).

          <h3>Stop Making Sense in IMAX</h3>

          I did not think this was possible. And by far the greatest IMAX experience I ever had.

          <h3>December renaissance: Secrets & Lies</h3>

          After a very slow three month stretch in Sep-Nov, I picked
          up in November. And then I watched Secrets & Lies and all my
          faith in Cinema was restored (lol, as if I had lost it). It
          is just so magical to watch an absolute masterpiece, the
          kind of film that transcends every barrier we think we can
          surmount.

          <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

          <ul>

            <li> In 2024 I wanted to improve on Brazilian films and on films directed by women. Had only a marginal improvement in the former (from 9 to 12) and actually got worse in the latter (from 24 to 18).
            </li>
            <li>I had the feeling this had been a less eclectic year for me, country-wise, and indeed: I saw films from 20 different countries this year, versus 24 in 2023. Moreover, while my rate of US films was similar to last year's (59% vs 58%), I also saw a bunch of films from the UK (8.5%, vs 2.5% last year), which feels a bit like US films... so almost 70% of US-like films, which is similar to the rate I've been trying to reduce.</li>

            <li>35 2-films days (vs 39 in 2023), but only 5 3-films days. Second year in a row with above-average 2-films days, but for 3-films days it seems 2023 was just an outlier (11 such days).

              For some fun, I had 5 2-cinema days, and one 3-cinema day in 2024. That was quite prodigious. I had only a single 3-cinema day before (20190104), and 5 2-cinema days in 2017, 3 in in 2018, 1 in 2019, 3 in 2020 (all in January and February...), none in 2021 (damn you COVID), 2 in 2022, and 7 (!!) in 2023.

              It has been six years since I saw more than 3 films in a day (last time was <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=20190112&header=Films_seen_in_2019-01-12">2019-01-12</a>), and almost seven since I saw five (2018-03-03)

          <h2>Best new (from 2022) films first watched in 2024</h2>

          <p style="font-size: small"><b>Note</b>: In 2023 I tried to pretend this was a "best of the year" list, but it's silly to do this if you are not somebody who goes to movie festivals worldwide, has access to advanced copies of films and does not care to wait to see films in a movie theater if they are only gonna open in the following year. As I'm not such a person, I always only settle on a "best of the year" list well into the first semester of the following year... Of the twelve films in my <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?list=2023best">Best of 2023</a> list three have changed since then, and it may change still as there are 2023 films I still want to see. For 2024, given how thin the field has been so far, I expect (hope!) for an ever bigger change, so I'll settle for something more faithful here as "the best among what I managed to see in 2024 among new films". Which is actually more useful because then I can highlight films I'd have potentially added to "best of" lists of previous years (like <i>Showing Up</i>, from 2022).</p>

          So far there have been considerably fewer impressive films from 2024 than there were from
          2023. That is not a fair comparison of course because I also saw several 2023 films in 2024 (including some of <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?list=2024best2023filmsSeenIn2024">very, very good films</a>, a few of which stand in my current <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?list=2023best">Best of 2023</a> list).

      <hr>
      0. <a class="fn" id="fn:0" href="#ref:fn0">&uarr;</a> I started seriously collecting data on my movie watching in 2015, so that's when history starts.
      <br>
      1.  <a class="fn" id="fn:1" href="#ref:fn1">&uarr;</a> The bars equate the number of movies watched in the respective week, and I define a week as starting on Mondays. Week 1 of 2023 is the week starting on the first day of 2023 that is a Monday. Thus, since 2023-01-01 was a Sunday, the plot has to include the last week of 2022, of which that Sunday was a part of. But only the films watched in the 2023 part of that week, i.e., on 2023-01-01, are represented in the plot. Week 1 starts on 2023-01-02, as expected.
      <br>
      2.  <a class="fn" id="fn:2" href="#ref:fn2">&uarr;</a> Probably thanks to an
      absolute awful winter that I spent alone in Iowa City, including a
      three-day period with -50°C!
      <br>
      3.  <a class="fn" id="fn:3" href="#ref:fn3">&uarr;</a> Besides the end of the DARPA
      crunch as well as the end of the teaching semester at UFMG.
      <br>
      4.  <a class="fn" id="fn:4" href="#ref:fn4">&uarr;</a> 2023 was a crazy year for me, traveling-wise. I spent 46 days away from home for work trips and 48 days in personal trips.

      <br>
      5.  <a class="fn" id="fn:5" href="#ref:fn5">&uarr;</a> I got carried away and <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/list/films-i-have-in-physical-media/">these are all the films</a> I have gotten in 2023 (up to <i>Interstellar</i>). I started to get not only Criterion editions when I realized the big difference in quality that physical media provides, that I have no reasonable way of reproducing.

      <br>
      6.  <a class="fn" id="fn:6" href="#ref:fn6">&uarr;</a> Alas, there are no
      commercial cinemas in Brazil anymore showing films actually on film, let alone
      in 70mm or in IMAX 70mm.

      <br>
      7. <a class="fn" id="fn:7" href="#ref:fn7">&uarr;</a> It is actually tricky to
      determine where a film "is from." If you take how Letterboxd does it, it lists
      the countries of a film based on the production companies involved in producing
      the film; all of them, indiscriminately. That will not do. I've decided to go
      the same way as the Academy of Motion Pictures goes, for films competing in the
      international category: "The submitting country must confirm that creative
      control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens or residents of the
      submitting country" (I only looked up this definition when writing this overview
      though, so we are only retroactively in sync, lol). So what I did was go through
      every film I watched since 2015 and tag them with the one country I think had
      the creative control, broadly defined (generally what country was most involved
      in the production and, if that was not very clear, where the creators of the
      film are from). It is a bit unsatisfactory sometimes to have only one country
      listed though, so I may revisit that in the future.
      <br>
      8. <a class="fn" id="fn:8" href="#ref:fn8">&uarr;</a> Letterboxd tells me the
      most common "movie theme" for me in 2023
      was <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/films/diary/for/2023/mini-theme/car-cars-racing-speed-adrenaline/by/date/">"Adrenaline-Fueled
        Action And Fast Cars"</a>, lol. Although only <i>Le Mans</i> is actually from the Criterion Channel series.

      <br>
      9. <a class="fn" id="fn:9" href="#ref:fn9">&uarr;</a> I rate films according to
      how much I liked them, which I equate to how good they are to me. In the past I
      have tried to be more objective ("I don't like this film but it's good because
      of this and that" etc but I think this is pointless for me, since I approach
      this as a hobby and the rating serves only me, basically). The rating goes
      roughly as
      <center>
        10 - Monumental
        <br>
        9 - Superb
        <br>
        8 - Great
        <br>
        7 - Very good
        <br>
        6 - Good
        <br>
        5 - Meh (aka "very flawed but kinda somewhat nice")
        <br>
        4 - Poor
        <br>
        3 - Bad
        <br>
        2 - Terrible
        <br>
        1 - Unimaginably awful
        <br>
      </center>

      I also use high and low qualifiers (the arrows by the numbers) for ratings below
      10 to further expand the scoring system.
      <br>
      10. <a class="fn" id="fn:10" href="#ref:fn10">&uarr;</a> I started using "high"
      and "low" qualifiers in 2020, and ever since only 15% of the films I rate have
      had that rating or higher. That number is a bit skewed though because of the older
      movies I'm ever catching up with (and they invariably have a higher selection
      bias). Considering only films from 2018 on, the percentage is actually only 11%.
      <br>
      11. <a class="fn" id="fn:11" href="#ref:fn11">&uarr;</a> I will still take it
      one short at a time... I saw <i>Civic</i> the other day and did not log it, for
      example, since I don't think it left a proper impression on me to justify
      it. But <i>Black Panthers</i> did, so that I'll log... still unhappy about this
      lack of clear criteria though.
