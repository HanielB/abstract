          <br>
          <br>

          <p>I started doing a summary of my year in movie-watching <a href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/year-review/2023.html">last year</a>, and I quite liked the experience. So here I'll summarize again some of the data analysis stuff for my movie-watching in 2024, as well as look into the films I watched that I loved the most.</p>

          <p>2024 was the 10th year since I decided to take watching films "more seriously", which amounted to log, rate, and (when I have the energy for it) write about each time I see a film. After a couple slow years (~60 films/year, although alreday above however many I was watching before), in 2017 things picked up (I saw <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2017&header=Films_watched_in_2017">198 films in 2017</a>) and have been stable ever since (an average of ~165 films/year, with a minimum of <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2021&header=Films_watched_in_2021">142 in 2021</a> and a maximum of <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2023&header=Films_watched_in_2023">204 in 2023</a>). I am happy with how this whole project took shape, because I've fallen in love with cinema in these 10 years in a way I did not anticipate. It still brings me so much joy, and there is so much to discover.</p>

          <p>Following up on 2023, 2024 was again a strong year for movie-watching for me: 189 films watched (includes rewatches), behind only 2023 and 2017, and 65 in movie theaters, behind only 2023. There were not that many great films from 2024, but in my never-ending catching up with old great films I've seen several amazing ones.</p>

          <h2>The Journey</h2>


          <p>The overview of my movie watching in 2024 is summarized in the
            plot<a class="ref" id="ref:fn1" href="#fn:1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> below. The
            green bars are for films watched in a cinema.  In the X axis by the
            names of the months are the number of watched films in that month,
            with the max and min months in bold.</p>

          Weeks 34, 35, 36: vacation after a <i>very long</i> and intense teaching semester due to a strike and thus lots of work travel that were supposed to happen during a break on teaching happening among teaching.

          <h3>Once Upon a Time in the West in a cinema</h3>

          Those close-ups on Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda on a big screen are the stuff of heaven.

          <h3>70s extravaganza</h3>

          Coppola program at Humberto Mauro kicking off with The
          Godfater, The Godfather Part II, The Conversation (missed
          Apocalypse Now, which I'd only catch up with in ...), and
          the following Monday I saw Sorcerer for the first time.

          <a href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=20240412..20240415">the four films</a>

          <h3>Wuxia!</h3>

          Wuxia program at Humberto Mauro closing with Hero, one of my
          favorite films. I could not see as many as I wanted because
          of work but still caught a lot of kung-fu and had the
          amazing finish. But most importantly it was reinvigorating
          and kickstarted my return to form for watching
          <i>filminhos</i> (greatly helped by me going into vacation,
          of course).

          <h3>Stop Making Sense in IMAX</h3>

          I did not think this was possible. And by far the greatest IMAX experience I ever had.

          <h3>December renaissance: Secrets & Lies</h3>

          After a very slow three month stretch in Sep-Nov, I picked
          up in November. And then I watched Secrets & Lies and all my
          faith in Cinema was restored (lol, as if I had lost it). It
          is just so magical to watch an absolute masterpiece, the
          kind of film that transcends every barrier we think we can
          surmount.

          <a name="misc"></a>
          <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

          <ul>

            <li> In 2024 I wanted to improve on Brazilian films and on films directed by women. Had only a marginal improvement in the former (from 9 to 12) and actually got worse in the latter (from 24 to 18).
            </li>
            <li>I had the feeling this had been a less eclectic year for me, country-wise, and indeed: I saw films from 20 different countries this year, versus 24 in 2023. Moreover, while my rate of US films was similar to last year's (59% vs 58%), I also saw a bunch of films from the UK (8.5%, vs 2.5% last year), which feels a bit like US films... so almost 70% of US-like films, which is similar to the rate I've been trying to reduce.</li>

            <li>35 2-films days (vs 39 in 2023), but only 5 3-films days. Second year in a row with above-average 2-films days, but for 3-films days it seems 2023 was just an outlier (11 such days).

              For some fun, I had 5 2-cinema days, and one 3-cinema day in 2024. That was quite prodigious. I had only a single 3-cinema day before (20190104), and 5 2-cinema days in 2017, 3 in in 2018, 1 in 2019, 3 in 2020 (all in January and February...), none in 2021 (damn you COVID), 2 in 2022, and 7 (!!) in 2023.

              It has been six years since I saw more than 3 films in a day (last time was <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=20190112&header=Films_seen_in_2019-01-12">2019-01-12</a>), and almost seven since I saw five (2018-03-03)

          <h2>Best new (from 2022) films first watched in 2024</h2>

          <p style="font-size: small"><b>Note</b>: In 2023 I tried to pretend this was a "best of the year" list, but it's silly to do this if you are not somebody who goes to movie festivals worldwide and has access to advance copies of films (besides not caring to wait to see the films in a movie theater if they are only gonna open in the following year). As I'm not such a person, I only settle on a "best of the year" list well into the first semester of the following year... Of the twelve films in my <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?list=2023best">Best of 2023</a> list three have changed through 2024, and it may change still since there are 2023 films I still want to see. It's an evolving thing. For 2024, given how thin the field has been so far, I expect (hope!) for an ever bigger change, so for the purposes of this review I'll do what makes more sense: the "best first <i>new films</i> watched <i>in 2024</i>". It is also more useful because then I can highlight films I'd have potentially added to "best of" lists of previous years (like <i>Showing Up</i>, from 2022).</p>

          <br>

          <br>

          A surprising challenge of this was mixing in the ranking the films of 2024 with those of 2022 and 2023, since I'm only used to do this for the films of a given calendar year. This is further complicated by the fact that there were few films from 2024 that I managed to see in 2024 that were actually impressive. There is one spectacular film, a truly great one, and three more that are very, very, very good. Beyond that there are many good films, some even very good, but none at the level that I'm used to include in my "Best of" lists for a given year. Through the next couple months there are several hyped 2024 films that are gonna open in Brazil and I'll finally catch up to (the one I'm most excited for is <i>Anora</i>, which opens next week). But still it's clear that 2024 is gonna be below 2023 by a large margin (in fairness, 2023 was a very strong year).


          <ol reversed>
            <li><b>Godzilla Minus One (2023, JP)</b></li>

            A great time at the movies, and the last film I saw in IMAX in
            2023. I <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/godzilla-minus-one/">really
              liked the film</a> and its balance between drama and action that
            manages to involve us in the story, creating the necessary stakes
            for the (amazing, brutal) spectacle it provides. I also loved the
            soundtrack, to which I've been listening to very often since then
            (in fact, listening to it as I'm writing this).

            <li><b>Retratos Fantasmas (2023, BR)</b></li>

            A personal love story for one's own obsessions and the places
            where we belong. Touching and
            beautiful. It <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/pictures-of-ghosts/">hit
              me hard</a>. It was a joy to see it in a street cinema in Belo
            Horizonte, as it should be.

            <li><b>Passages (2023, FR)</b></li>

            A film that stayed with me since
            it <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/passages-2023/">swept
              me away</a>. I loved walking home from the theater while
            reminiscing the film, thinking of Tomas riding his bike through
            Paris, forced to live with himself. It's a film that talks about
            the chaos of our lives and is very striking in no small part
            because of the leads, which are all amazing, with performances
            that I often catch myself thinking of.

            <li><b>Anatomie d'une chute (2023, FR)</b></li>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/anatomy-of-a-fall/">Another
              film</a> that stayed with me, thanks specially to the tenderness
            of the kid's performance who has the most heartbreaking scene of
            the film. Also, the first Palm d'Or I truly loved
            since <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/D7vj9">Shoplifters</a>, in 2018
            (which was
            actually <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?list=2018best">my
              favorite film of that year</a>),
            and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/VmieR">Parasite</a> in 2019.

            <li><b>Monster (2023, JP)</b></li>

            And speaking of Kore-eda, what an absolute delight is to watch his
            films. I had not watched anything from him since the
            aforementioned <i>Shoplifters</i> in 2019, so it was great to see
            both <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/rDUU">Broker</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/DJEM">Monster</a>
            in 2023. I <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/480nXz">liked the former</a>,
            but the latter... it is only rated low 8 because I disliked a
            significant chunk of it, but what I liked
            I <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/monster-2023/"><i>absolutely
              loved</i></a>. The absolute devastating ending has some subjective
            elements that make me really want to revisit the film.

            <li><b>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023, US)</b></li>

            Now we get to high 8's up territory<a class="ref" id="ref:fn10"
                                                  href="#fn:10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>, where almost all is forgiven
            given the sheer power of the film in front of me
            (lol). As <i>Across the Spider-Verse</i> unfolded I got a bit
            afraid it'd be one of the greatest films I ever saw (I was truly
            <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse/">floored
              by its first segment</a>), but things calmed down a bit. Amazing
            film that is only really hurt by not being a full film.

            <li><b>Shin Kamen Rider (2023, JP)</b></li>

            Utter shock. That's what comes to mind when I remember this
            film. I can still hardly believe that it manages to do what it
            does. A unique, astonishing film, that
            I <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/shin-kamen-rider/">poorly
              tried to describe</a> when I saw it. Just watch it. But play it
            <i>loud</i>. This film <i>demands</i> it.

            <li><b>John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023, US)</b></li>

            The first film in this list that I saw in 2023. I was already sure
            in March, when I first saw it, that would be in this list. It's such an amazing film. I rewatched the John Wick
            series coming in to this one and I was skeptical
            after <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/42bijx">John Wick 3</a> that this
            one would be anything beyond a nice film. Well, I was happily
            proven wrong. I particularly loved how sound is used in the
            film. <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/42AZRd">Loved, loved it</a>.

            <li><b>Asteroid City (2023, US)</b></li>

            As I mentioned, 2023 for was for me the Year of Wes Anderson and
            his new feature was <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/4CBbmZ">at first
              elusive</a> for me (rated <i>only</i> high 7, lol), but it shot up
            to high 8 as <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/4LM3zp">I rewatched it</a>
            and stayed there when I saw it <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/4PrzNR">a
              third time</a>. It particularly spoke to me in my struggle feeling
            overwhelmed in 2023 and trying to carry on, to make it work even
            though I don't understand the play.

            <li><b>The Swan (2023, US)</b></li>

            Now this thing made something new for me: to rate a
            short. Normally I would not even log short films, but the series
            of shorts that Wes Anderson made in 2023 forced me to reconsider
            this. They have a unique artistry, identity, and, most importantly
            (to the purposes of this whole exercise), had a distinct impact on
            me. So I made peace with logging shorts<a class="ref"
                                                      id="ref:fn11" href="#fn:11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> and went further
            with <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/the-swan-2023/">The
              Swan</a>, a masterpiece. Given the whole situation, a bit afraid
            to revisit it though.

            <li><b>Oppenheimer (2023, US)</b></li>

            As I said in the highlights, I loved this film to the point of
            watching it <a target="_blank"
                           href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?title=oppenheimer&watched=2023&header=Oppenheimer_in_2023">four
              times in theaters</a>. If it was still in theaters I'd watch it
            again
            tomorrow. I <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?header=Christopher_Nolan&director=christopher.nolan&sorting=year&singleton=1&watchlist=1&available=yes">love
              Nolan</a> and <i>Oppenheimer</i> is him at his best for building an
            irresistible narrative, filming gorgeously and adding killer sound. The
            tragedy of Oppenheimer the character was also very relatable to me,
            given the academic context and all. And the ending always breaks me.

            <li><b>Killers of the Flower Moon (2023, US)</b></li>

            My favorite film of 2023 is also the one I had the most
            expectations before going in to see. I have watched <i>a
              lot</i> of
            Scorsese <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2019..&director=scorsese&header=Scorsese_films_seen_since_2019">in
              the last few years</a> and have therefore grown to love him. Him being a champion of cinema of course helps. Fact is
            that <i>Killers of the Flower
              Moon</i> <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/524ZHB">delivered</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/53j1Oh">again</a>
            and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/5fkF31">again</a>, a magnificent
            experience. Sad, devastating, and magical. May Scorsese live
            forever.

      0. <a class="fn" id="fn:0" href="#ref:fn0">&uarr;</a> I started seriously collecting data on my movie watching in 2015, so that's when history starts.
      <br>
      1.  <a class="fn" id="fn:1" href="#ref:fn1">&uarr;</a> The bars equate the number of movies watched in the respective week, and I define a week as starting on Mondays. Week 1 of 2023 is the week starting on the first day of 2023 that is a Monday. Thus, since 2023-01-01 was a Sunday, the plot has to include the last week of 2022, of which that Sunday was a part of. But only the films watched in the 2023 part of that week, i.e., on 2023-01-01, are represented in the plot. Week 1 starts on 2023-01-02, as expected.
      <br>
      2.  <a class="fn" id="fn:2" href="#ref:fn2">&uarr;</a> Probably thanks to an
      absolute awful winter that I spent alone in Iowa City, including a
      three-day period with -50°C!
      <br>
      3.  <a class="fn" id="fn:3" href="#ref:fn3">&uarr;</a> Besides the end of the DARPA
      crunch as well as the end of the teaching semester at UFMG.
      <br>
      4.  <a class="fn" id="fn:4" href="#ref:fn4">&uarr;</a> 2023 was a crazy year for me, traveling-wise. I spent 46 days away from home for work trips and 48 days in personal trips.

      <br>
      5.  <a class="fn" id="fn:5" href="#ref:fn5">&uarr;</a> I got carried away and <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/list/films-i-have-in-physical-media/">these are all the films</a> I have gotten in 2023 (up to <i>Interstellar</i>). I started to get not only Criterion editions when I realized the big difference in quality that physical media provides, that I have no reasonable way of reproducing.

      <br>
      6.  <a class="fn" id="fn:6" href="#ref:fn6">&uarr;</a> Alas, there are no
      commercial cinemas in Brazil anymore showing films actually on film, let alone
      in 70mm or in IMAX 70mm.

      <br>
      7. <a class="fn" id="fn:7" href="#ref:fn7">&uarr;</a> It is actually tricky to
      determine where a film "is from." If you take how Letterboxd does it, it lists
      the countries of a film based on the production companies involved in producing
      the film; all of them, indiscriminately. That will not do. I've decided to go
      the same way as the Academy of Motion Pictures goes, for films competing in the
      international category: "The submitting country must confirm that creative
      control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens or residents of the
      submitting country" (I only looked up this definition when writing this overview
      though, so we are only retroactively in sync, lol). So what I did was go through
      every film I watched since 2015 and tag them with the one country I think had
      the creative control, broadly defined (generally what country was most involved
      in the production and, if that was not very clear, where the creators of the
      film are from). It is a bit unsatisfactory sometimes to have only one country
      listed though, so I may revisit that in the future.
      <br>
      8. <a class="fn" id="fn:8" href="#ref:fn8">&uarr;</a> Letterboxd tells me the
      most common "movie theme" for me in 2023
      was <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/films/diary/for/2023/mini-theme/car-cars-racing-speed-adrenaline/by/date/">"Adrenaline-Fueled
        Action And Fast Cars"</a>, lol. Although only <i>Le Mans</i> is actually from the Criterion Channel series.

      <br>
      9. <a class="fn" id="fn:9" href="#ref:fn9">&uarr;</a> I rate films according to
      how much I liked them, which I equate to how good they are to me. In the past I
      have tried to be more objective ("I don't like this film but it's good because
      of this and that" etc but I think this is pointless for me, since I approach
      this as a hobby and the rating serves only me, basically). The rating goes
      roughly as
      <center>
        10 - Monumental
        <br>
        9 - Superb
        <br>
        8 - Great
        <br>
        7 - Very good
        <br>
        6 - Good
        <br>
        5 - Meh (aka "very flawed but kinda somewhat nice")
        <br>
        4 - Poor
        <br>
        3 - Bad
        <br>
        2 - Terrible
        <br>
        1 - Unimaginably awful
        <br>
      </center>

      I also use high and low qualifiers (the arrows by the numbers) for ratings below
      10 to further expand the scoring system.
      <br>
      10. <a class="fn" id="fn:10" href="#ref:fn10">&uarr;</a> I started using "high"
      and "low" qualifiers in 2020, and ever since only 15% of the films I rate have
      had that rating or higher. That number is a bit skewed though because of the older
      movies I'm ever catching up with (and they invariably have a higher selection
      bias). Considering only films from 2018 on, the percentage is actually only 11%.
      <br>
      11. <a class="fn" id="fn:11" href="#ref:fn11">&uarr;</a> I will still take it
      one short at a time... I saw <i>Civic</i> the other day and did not log it, for
      example, since I don't think it left a proper impression on me to justify
      it. But <i>Black Panthers</i> did, so that I'll log... still unhappy about this
      lack of clear criteria though.
