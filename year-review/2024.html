          </center>

          <br>
          <br>

          <p>I started doing a summary of my year in movie-watching <a href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/year-review/2023.html">last year</a>,
          and I quite liked the experience. So here I'll summarize again some of
          the data analysis stuff for my movie-watching in 2024, as well as look
          into the films I watched that I loved the most. It makes
            me reminisce about all these great films and the wonder of it all.</p>

          <p>2024 was the 10th year since I decided to take watching films "more seriously" (I call it my serious hobby), which amounted to log, rate, and (when I have the energy for it) write about each time I see a film. After a couple slow years (~60 film watches/year, although alreday above however many I was watching before), I saw <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2017&header=Films_watched_in_2017">198 films in 2017</a>, and ever since have been averaging ~165 films/year, with a minimum of <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2021&header=Films_watched_in_2021">142 in 2021</a> and a maximum of <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2023&header=Films_watched_in_2023">204 in 2023</a>. I am really happy with how this whole project took shape, because I've fallen in love with cinema in these 10 years in a way I did not anticipate. I certainly liked films before, but now I love them absolutely. They bring me so much joy, and there is so much to discover.</p>

          <p>Following up on 2023, 2024 was again a strong year for movie-watching for me: 189 films watched (includes rewatches), behind only 2023 and 2017, and 65 in movie theaters, behind only 2023. There were not that many great films from 2024 that I could see last year, but still there was no shortage of amazing films, as I'm ever catching up with old great ones.</p>

          <h2>The Journey</h2>


          <p>The overview of my movie watching in 2024 is summarized in the
            plot<a class="ref" id="ref:fn0" href="#fn:0"><sup>[0]</sup></a> below. The
            green bars are for films watched in a cinema.  In the X axis by the
            names of the months are the number of watched films in that month,
            with the max and min months in bold.</p>

          <br>
          <span><img src="./images/2024/2024.png"  class="img-responsive" style="width: 100%"/></span>
          <br>

          <p>I was in the US in January and in between vacation and work
          I did not get to see many films in comparison with my regular Januaries<a class="ref" id="ref:fn1" href="#fn:1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>,
          but at least I got to see <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=20231220..202401&tags=cinema&header=Cinema_in_US_trip_2023/2024">several films</a> in
            a cinema that would only open in Brazil a few months later.</p>

          <p>I came back to Brazil in February and picked up the pace I was on in
          the second semestre of 2023. In February and March I watched a lot of
          films, averaging over 5 films per week, and went a lot to the
            cinema<a class="ref" id="ref:fn2" href="#fn:2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. With
          work picking up and the year wearing on me I regressed to the mean for
          the next three months, with ~3.5 films per week, but still ended up
          the first half of 2024 with an average exactly of 4 films per week,
            which is the number I have in mind of how many films I'd <i>like</i> to see
          weekly on average. By June I had gone 42 times to a cinema, which put
          me on track to have 2024 as the year in which I'd go the cinema the
          most (2023 has the recond of 70 times).</p>


          <p>The journey was about to get harder though. We had a strike at UFMG
            for two months that ended in June, and coming back from it
            everything was rushed and the teaching got very intense, specially
            because I had to juggle it around work trips that always happen in
            July, when I'm not supposed to be teaching. The odd week in this
            period was Week 27, when I was in Nancy/FR for work and managed to
            see many films in my beloved <a href="https://www.cameo-nancy.fr/">Cameo Cinema</a>.</p>

            <p>Only in late August things eased up, when I finally took a
            vacation. I saw lots of films and went lots of times to the
            cinema. As in a similar bounce back in 2023, I was helped also by a
            series ran by the <a target="_blank" href="https://fcs.mg.gov.br/espacos-culturais/palacio-das-artes/cine-humberto-mauro/">Cine
            Humberto Mauro</a> in Belo Horizonte, this one dedicated to Wuxia
            films, which I love.</p>

          <p>Differently from 2023 though, I could not sustain the momentum. A
          very busy working period started in September, with a particularly
          complicated teaching semester, lots of travel<a class="ref" id="ref:fn3" href="#fn:3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>,
            and getting sick a few times. October was particularly hard in that
            regard. In November I bounced back some, but the clearest signal to
            me that I was struggling filmwise was that from mid-September to
            early December I saw only
            <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=20240913..20241207&tags=cinema&header=Cinema_in_hard_2024_period">3 films in a cinema</a> (but two are among my 2024 favorites), less than I saw in the
            second week of December alone.</p>

          <p>The year wrapped with a lot of travel and less movies watched,
            but I took advantage of a week home in mid-December to catch-up on
            films that were in theaters and on a Kiarostami-Ray-Yang series at Cine
            Humberto Mauro<a class="ref" id="ref:fn4" href="#fn:4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. Despite the ups and downs, it's been wonderful. Here
            are <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2024&header=Films_watched_in_2024">all
            the films I saw in 2024</a>.</p>

          <a name="highlights"></a>
          <h2>Highlights</h2>

          <p style="font-size: small"><b>Note</b>: The cards below have the
            date relative to that watch of the respective film, where I was then, and the rating
            I gave to that watch<a class="ref" id="ref:fn5"
                                   href="#fn:5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. The circled arrows say that watch
            was a rewatch. In grey there are tags for things like if I saw
            the movie in a cinema, if I cried, if I dozed-off, etc.

          <h3><span class="italic">Perfect Days</span> saves the day</h3>

          <br>

          <p>I loved <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/perfect-days-2023/"><i>Perfect Days</i></a> when <a href="https://boxd.it/5ShHN1">I first saw it</a>,
            specially how it encapsulated a sense of living in the present and
            seeing value in the beauty of everyday life. I spent the whole week
            thinking about the film, specially as I went through some tough days
            where staying in the moment proved elusive. I went to rewatch the film almost as a cry for help, and it delivered. Much like Mia Farrow in <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-purple-rose-of-cairo/"><i>The Purple Rose of Cairo</i></a>,
            I caught myself smiling despite myself as the film started. It was <a href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/perfect-days-2023/1/">a
            beautiful thing</a>.</p>


          <h3>Rewatching <span class="italic">Oppenheimer</span> and <span class="italic">Killers of the Flower Moon</span></h3>

          <br>
          <center>
            <span><img src="./images/2024/opp-killers.png"  class="doublecard"/></span>
          </center>
          <br>

          <p>Much like in 2023, I got to rewatch in a cinema my two favorite films of a previous year: <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/gHp0"><i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/wUow"><i>Oppenheimer</i></a>,
            my favorite and second-favorite films of 2023. This was by chance, because <i>Oppenheimer</i> was running again (on IMAX!) because of its anticipated Oscar success, I assume, and <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> probably
            because somebody at Cinemark wanted to make me happy (actually it
            was also because Cinemark was doing some sort of Oscar "Best
            Picture nominations" series). It was my <a href="https://boxd.it/60ZN6H">fourth</a> time for <i>Killers</i> and <a href="https://boxd.it/5QGJsh">fifth</a> for <i>Oppenheimer</i> seeing
            them in all their prowess. It was glorious.</p>

          <h3>Once Upon a Time in the West in a cinema</h3>

          <br>
          <center>
            <span><img src="./images/2024/once-upon-a-time-in-the-west.png"  class="singlecard"/></span>
          </center>
          <br>

          <p>Those close-ups on Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda on a big screen
          are the stuff of heaven. It was my first time seeing this masterpiece
            in a cinema, and <a href="https://boxd.it/647vGF">I just loved it</a>. Cine
          Humberto Mauro often does these one-off screenings of classics outside
          larger thematic series and it's a great opportunity if not to see some
          films for the first time but at least for the first time to see them as they were meant to be seen (or
          at least in a approximation of, since it's digital projection...).</p>

          <h3>70s extravaganza</h3>

          <br>
          <center>
            <span><img src="./images/2024/70s.png"  class="doublecard"/></span>
          </center>
          <br>

          <p>Cine Humberto Mauro announced a Coppola series (probably because <i>Megalopolis</i> was
          gonna be coming out later in the year<a class="ref" id="ref:fn6" href="#fn:6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>) and the first four films were:
            <i>The Godfather</i>, <i>The Godfather Part II</i>, <i>The Conversation</i>, and <i>Apocalypse
              Now</i>. Tantalizing! There should have been lines around the
            block. In reality the screenings were far from full and it was pretty chill. I caught only the first three
            (loved much more <i>The Godfather</i> <a href="https://boxd.it/6hb4ad" target="_blank">this time around</a>, realized I was actually seeing <i>Part II</i> <a href="https://boxd.it/6hYoyx">for the first time</a>, and loved <i>The Conversation</i> more <a href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/the-conversation/1/">this time</a> also,
            after spending a year thinking about it) and right after watched <i>Sorcerer</i> for
            the first time, in a Friedkin series at the Criterion Channel. <a href="https://boxd.it/6ij2eR">Liked it a lot</a>! It was a lot of 70s cinema in a short burst and I was all in for it.</p>

          <h3>French cinemas</h3>

          <br>
          <center>
            <span><img src="./images/2024/french-cinemas.png"  class="doublecard"/></span>
          </center>
          <br>

          <p>My dive into this serious hobby started when I was living in Nancy/FR,
          as I did my PhD. The <a href="https://www.cameo-nancy.fr/">Cameo Cinema</a> was
          a big part of this, with its very diverse programming and focus on
          cinema itself (it's the only commercial movie theater I've seen that
          forbids food and beverages; I wish they were all like this). I spent
          two weeks in Nancy in late June/early July for work and I
          managed to go to Cameo <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=20240620..20240706&tags=cinema&header=Films_watched_in_a_cinema_in_France_(2024)">several times</a> (and once in Paris on the way back), including to see <i>Kinds of Kindness</i>,
          which I was looking forward to a lot (it was a <a href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/kinds-of-kindness/">great ride</a>), and <i>Paris, Texas</i>,
          which I had never seen. I had been back to Cameo in 2023 after many
          years away (I left Nancy in 2017), but it was the one time and felt
          kinda rushed. This time it felt much better. I miss it already.</p>

          <h3>Wuxia!</h3>

          <br>
          <center>
            <span><img src="./images/2024/wuxia.png"  class="doublecard"/></span>
          </center>
          <br>

          <p>The Wuxia series at Cine Humberto Mauro came right when I most needed
          it to rekindle my moviewatching drive, as I was heading into vacation. Specially as it was slated to end with <i>Hero</i>,
          one of my favorite films and that I had not seen in ten years. I ended
          up not seeing as many films as I wanted because of work but still
          caught a lot of kung-fu and had the most amazing finish possible (the
          first film I rated 10 in 2024). But most importantly it was
          reinvigorating and kickstarted my return to form for watching
          <i>filminhos</i>.</p>

          <h3><i>Stop Making Sense</i> in IMAX</h3>

          <br>
          <center>
            <span><img src="./images/2024/stopmakingsense.png"  class="doublecard"/></span>
          </center>
          <br>

          <p>A truly <a href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/stop-making-sense/">religious experience</a>. I
          did not think it was possible for a film to impact me the way this
          one did. Cinema really is everything. And by far the greatest IMAX
          experience I ever had. It only ran here for a week so I rushed to see it again a few days later. Unbelievable stuff.</p>

          <h3>December renaissance: <i>Secrets & Lies</i></h3>

          <br>
          <center>
            <span><img src="./images/2024/secrets.png"  class="singlecard"/></span>
          </center>
          <br>

          <p>After the very slow three month stretch in Sep-Nov, I picked up
            momentum in November, but I was still going very little to cinemas and
            seeing few films that truly excited me. Then <a href="https://boxd.it/80yqsx">I watched <i>Secrets & Lies</i></a> and
          all my faith in Cinema was restored (lol, as if I had lost it). It is
          just so magical, so reinvigorating to watch an absolute masterpiece,
          the kind of film that transcends every barrier we think we can
            surmount. It carried me to the end.</p>

          <a name="misc"></a>
          <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>With my very strong second semester of 2023 (4.83 films per
            week) and strong first semester of 2024 (4.00 films per week), I had
            my highest average of films per week in a twelve month period (4.44)
            and of course the highest total (231). The previous highest was also
            from July to June, of 2018 to 2019: 4.01 films per week to a total
            of 209. There is a big difference in the number of films seen in a
            cinema in the period though: 88 for this new high, 46 in the
            previous one. A testament that nowadays I go much more to the
            cinema, which makes me very happy.

            In a calendar year the highest numbers are all from 2023 (3.91 films
            per week to a total of 204), and going 70 times to a cinema.</li>

            <li> In 2024 I wanted to improve on Brazilian films and on films directed by women. Had only a marginal improvement in the former (from 9 to 12) and actually got worse in the latter (from 24 to 18). The goal continues for 2025...
            </li>
            <li>I had the feeling this had been a less eclectic year for me,
            country-wise, and indeed: I saw films from 20 different countries
            this year, versus 24 in 2023. Moreover, while my rate of US films
            was similar to 2023's (59% vs 58%), I also saw a bunch of films from
            the UK (8.5%, vs 2.5% in 2023), which feels a bit like US
            films... so almost 70% of anglophone films, which is similar to the
            historic rate of US films that I've been trying to reduce.</li>

            <li>There were 35 2-films days in 2024 (vs 39 in 2023) and five
              3-films days. Second year in a row with above-average 2-films days
              (~30), but for 3-films days it seems 2023 was just an outlier (11
              such days, while the average is about 3).

              For some fun, I had five 2-cinema days and one 3-cinema day in
              2024 (which was <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=20241214&header=Films_seen_in_2024-12-14_in_a_cinema">2024-12-14</a>). That was way ahead of most previous years. I had only a single
              3-cinema day before (<a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=20190104&header=Films_seen_in_2019-01-04_in_a_cinema">2019-01-04</a>),
              and five 2-cinema days in 2017, 3 in in 2018, 1 in 2019, 3 in 2020 and none in 2021<a class="ref" id="ref:fn7" href="#fn:7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>,
              2 in 2022, and 7 (!!) in 2023.
            </li>

            <li>I was 32 films while traveling in 2024, second only to 40 in
            2017<a class="ref" id="ref:fn8" href="#fn:8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>. And
            10 films in planes, tied with 2018. I fly and travel more nowadays
            than before, but I tend to watch less films in planes and while away
            from home nowadays.</li>

            <li> Comprehensive lists:

          <p>I like compiling the list of my favorite first watches of older films because there is so much I'm still catching up with and it can be so cathartic to discover these films.</p>

          <p>As I mentioned above, nothing was more impactful than seeing <i>Stop Making Sense</i> for the first time. Watching <i>Secrets & Lies</i> was
            a tremendous experience, reenergizing my love for this art form. I
            was mesmerized by <i>Brief Encounter</i>, finally almodóvarizado by <i>Hable con ella</i>. Overwhelmed by the tragedy of <i>Ônibus 174</i>. Provoked in such a magistral way by the audacity of Kiarostami and Jafar Panahi in <i>Close-Up</i> and <i>The Mirror</i>. I
            was lost to myself in the spell cast by the other films,
            all led by men sort of trying to escape from themselves,
            realizing they cannot, and facing the consequences.</p>

          <h2>Best new (from 2022) films first watched in 2024</h2>

          <p style="font-size: small"><b>Note</b>: In 2023 I tried to pretend I
          could do here a "best of the year" list, but it's silly to do this if
          you are not somebody who goes to movie festivals worldwide and/or has
          access to advance copies of films (besides not caring to wait to see
          the films in a movie theater if they are only gonna open in the
          following year). As I'm not such a person, I only settle on a "best of
          the year" list well into the first semester of the following
          year... Of the twelve films in my <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?list=2023best">Best of 2023</a> list
          three have changed through 2024, and it may change still since there
          are 2023 films I still want to see. It's an evolving thing. For 2024,
          given how thin the field has been so far, I expect (hope!) for an ever
          bigger change, so for the purposes of this review I'll do what makes
          more sense: the "best first <i>new films</i> watched <i>in 2024</i>". It is also more useful because then I can highlight films I'd have potentially added to "best of" lists of previous years (like <i>Showing Up</i>, from 2022).</p>

          <p>A surprising challenge for putting together this list was mixing in
          the ranking the films from 2024 with those from 2022 and 2023, since
          I'm only used to do this for the films of a given calendar year. This
          is further complicated by the fact that there were few films from 2024
          that I managed to see in 2024 that were actually impressive. There is
          one spectacular film, one truly great, and three more that are very,
          very, very good (all in this list). Beyond that there are many good
          films, some even very good, but none at the level that I'm used to
          including in my "Best of" lists for a given year. Through the next
          couple months there are several hyped 2024 films that are gonna open
          in Brazil and I'll finally catch up to. But still it's clear that 2024
          is gonna be below 2023 by a large margin (in fairness, 2023 was a very
          strong year).</p>

          <p>The list with the cards for the movies is available <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?list=2024bestNewFirstWatch">here</a>. Below is the list in decreasing order with a few words. I put in 15 films rather  the usual 12 so I could highligh more cool films.</p>

          <ol reversed>
            <li><b>Evil Does Not Exist (2023, JP)</b></li>

            <p>I had been looking forward to see Hamaguchi's follow up to <i>Drive My Car</i>,
            my favorite film of 2021, for a long time (it opened in festivals in
            2023...), and it was quite interesting to see how he went for a
            different register with <i>Evil Does Not Exist</i>. It
            did not hit me as hard as his favorites, but I still <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/78MXDZ">liked it a lot</a>. It
              has such a gentleness to it, a deliberate pace. And it is so
              gorgeous. It does have its flaws, but it is still such a powerful
              film.</p>

            <li><b>La passion de Dodin Bouffant (2023, FR)</b></li>

            <p>Another 2023 film I was very curious to see, given the hype,
              Binoche, and the subject (I love food and find professional
              cooking fascinating). I might have liked the film less than I
              thought I would, but it was still so nice to see and experience
              it. It <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/6n02mX">hit me hard</a>,
              specially the way the love between Dodin and Eugénie is depicted,
              how it revolves around a power struggle, yes, but also as a shared
              life based on upmost confidence in one another.</p>

            <li><b>Ferrari (2023, US)</b></li>

            <p>I've been slowly exploring Mann's filmography in the last years, and
              increasingly liking how he constructs his films and centers them
              around these tormented men who live in a surreal world where
              everything is heightened and they must prevail through sheer will. <i>Ferrari</i> is
              no different, and this is all masterfully embodied by a fearsome
              Adam Driver. Saw it twice and liked it even more the second time
              around (impressions <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/5ENT9P">here</a>
              and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/646OpL">here</a>). Ah, this terrible joy.</p>

            <li><b>Falcon Lake (2022, CA)</b></li>

            <p>A film that only got into my radar because it almost topped Mike
            D'Angelo's <a href="https://www.panix.com/~dangelo/2022.html">Best of 2022</a> list. <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/5Wvd6F">I was fascinated</a> by
            its depection of young love/friendship, how they intertwine in so
            familiar but still unique ways. The film also has a few
            exceptionally constructed scenes that take your breath away, all in
            service of an increasingly heartbreaking narrative that ends up
            leaving you torn apart.</p>

            <li><b>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022, US)</b></li>

            <p>I remember seeing a lot of praise for this film a few years ago when
            it premiered, but since I had not seen the first I kinda ignored
            it. Decided to give it a chance during a long flight and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/6TKrrN">was overwhelmed</a> by
            its exhilarating action, carefully constructed narrative,
            irresistible voice acting, and surprisingly tender and sincere
              emotional core.</p>

            <li><b>All of Us Strangers (2023, GB)</b></li>

            <p>Now I was ready for Paul Mescal, given how much i loved him in <i>Aftersun</i>,
              but Andrew Scott was a revelation (I only remembered him from <i>Sherlock</i>). He
              carries the film with an openness that had me completely
              surrendered. The film itself also works marvelously, despite its
              narrative flaws, and how it portrays its themes is beautiful,
              touching, evocative. Saw it twice a few months apart and it
              floored me both times (impressions <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/5IbR9j">here</a>
              and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/6bEKuj">here</a>).

            </p>

            <li><b>Kinds of Kindness (2024, GB)</b></li>

            <p>Finally a 2024 film (even if the later the better to show up in
              this list...). I love Yorgos Lanthimos so much. As I had heart
              this was a return to "strangeness" after his relatively less
              strange <i>The Favourite</i> and, specially, <i>Poor Things</i>, I
              was pumped. The film delivers. Covers the horror of control, which
              is so welcome, in an absurd, outrageous, hilariosu, mesmerizing
              way. It kind eluded me <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/6TIuVx">the
              first time</a> I think because of its anthology structure throwing
              me off a bit, but the <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/7gMui1">second
              time</a> it worked wonderfully. One has to atune properly to its humor.</p>

            <li><b>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024, US)</b></li>

            <p>On an off for the past ten years I would check the rumors that
              Miller was doing another <i>Mad Max</i> film
              centered on Furiosa. I was kinda surprised when I learned that
              indeed it was gonna happen and would come out in 2024, so I went all
              hyped to see it when it finally opened. In a sense I was disappointed, because <i>Fury
              Road</i> is what it is<a class="ref" id="ref:fn9" href="#fn:9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>,
              but I still loved this film quite a bit. Not only also for its
              action, but for its characters and the depection of their
              pain. But mostly for Tom Burke and his gaze. Saw it twice in IMAX
              and it was glorious (impressions <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/6yb9Dd">here</a>
              and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/6CmhQn">here</a>).</p>

            <li><b>The Zone of Interest (2023, GB)</b></li>

            <p>Belatedly made by <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?list=2023best">Best
            of 2023</a> list. Incredible film. Ominous, harrowing,
              accusatory. Shot in a way that seems mundane, but that
              lingers. May have the most effective credits rolling
              ever. Impressions <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/5IdexF">here</a>
              and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/5VyC2v">here</a>.</p>

            <li><b>Showing Up (2022, US)</b></li>

            <p>A jewel of a film. It can feel innocuous, but to me the
              unassuming narrative depects how hard it is to simply <i>show up</i>,
              to muster the courage, the energy, the abandon to do what you set
              out to. Nothing overt, but present nonetheless. I <a href="https://boxd.it/68T9yr">really
              loved it</a>.</p>

            <li><b>Ainda Estou Aqui (2024, BR)</b></li>

            <p>A masterful film with an incandescent lead performance that I'm
              glad it is being widely celebrated. I <a href="https://boxd.it/7NMQ43">left the cinema shattered</a>. Surviving
              is never easy.</p>

            <li><b>Past Lives (2023, US)</b></li>

            <p>Another late addition to my best of 2023. The pain for what never
              was is unbearable. Greta Lee and Teo Yoo <a href="https://boxd.it/5LHbkl">ripped
              my heart apart</a>. Celine Song is merciless, crafting a
              devastating ending amplifying it all.</p>

            <li><b>The Substance (2024, GB)</b></li>

            <p>I don't know, this film just appeals to me too much. The
              hyper-stylized reality, the super-sharp editing, the overwhelming
              sound, the outrageous narrative. All work wonders for me. It only
              falters in losing some momentum in the second half and in failing to
              create a more incisive emotional connection. I was ready to forgive
              it all after that insane final stretch though. Left me <a href ="https://boxd.it/7sLs0l">completely
              bewildered</a>. Coralie Fargeat is 2/2 and I can't wait for her next film.</p>

            <li><b>Perfect Days (2023, JP)</b></li>

            <p>As I wrote in the highlights, a quietly powerful film to the
              point of being my lifeline in a moment of need. It was my
              introduction to Wim Wenders and now <a href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?director=wim.wenders">I'm
              going through his filmography</a>, but so far nothing nearly as
              effective (although <i>Paris, Texas</i> was <a href="https://boxd.it/6TKfaP">quite
              somenthing</a>). I'll be thinking of Koji Yakusho's smile for a long time.</p>

            <p>This is the last addition to the list from the films released in
            the first trimester of 2024, which had a third of the titles here.</p>

            <li><b>Challengers (2024, US)</b></li>

            <p>My favorite film from 2024, which I suspect will continue to be
              the case when all is said and done<a class="ref" id="ref:fn10" href="#fn:10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>. Guadagnino
              creates an irresistible film full of sound and fury, signifying
              everything. An all encompassing experince that had me <a href="https://boxd.it/6pji5T">completely
              overwhelmed</a>, <a href="https://boxd.it/6viRMv">again</a> and <a href="https://boxd.it/6pji5T">again</a>. The
              soundtrack is bonkers, but used to such an effect in the film, in
              this perfect marriage of sound and image<a class="ref" id="ref:fn11" href="#fn:11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>. Otherwordly. </p>

          this together than in 2023 (January is almost over), so for next year
          I will start before January... but anayway, again I quite liked doing
          it and I am glad I have it written so I can better remember in the
          future how was my 2024 in <i>filminhos</i>. For 2025, I hope there will be many great films
          (more than in 2024... which I think is gonna be the case given all the
          things I'm already hyped for) and that I'll continue to be able to
          manage this lovely hobby!</p>

      0.  <a class="fn" id="fn:0" href="#ref:fn0">&uarr;</a> The bars equate the
      number of movies watched in the respective week, and I define a week as
      starting on Mondays. Week 1 of 2024 is the week starting on the first day
      of 2024 that is a Monday, which by coincidence was exactly
      2024-01-01. Likewise, the last week in the plot includes first week of
      2025, since there are 2024 days running into the first week of 2025. But
      only the films watched in the 2024 as part of that week are represented in
      the plot (which in this case were none, as in 2024-12-30 and 2024-12-31 I
      was in the isolated beach of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/YiXSJjyLC6GK3RHx8">Galos</a> and not really thinking about cinema).
      <br>
      1.  <a class="fn" id="fn:1" href="#ref:fn1">&uarr;</a> Since 2017 my
      average for January is almost 22 (!), while the overall monthly average is
      about 14.
      <br>
      2.  <a class="fn" id="fn:2" href="#ref:fn2">&uarr;</a> Many of the films
      that premier in the award season abroad only get to Brazil in Feb/Mar
      (so they can surf the Oscar hype, if any). I hate it.
      <br>
      3.  <a class="fn" id="fn:3" href="#ref:fn3">&uarr;</a> Including my first ever trip to Japan! It was amazing, and a highlight was to <a target="_blank" href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/MbtQcxJLqKqSTCgK8">stand in</a> the same bridge they filmed some scenes of <i>Perfect Days</i>, one my favorite films of 2023!
      <br>
      4.  <a class="fn" id="fn:4" href="#ref:fn4">&uarr;</a> I wrote almost exactly the same sentence in <a href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/year-review/2023.html#journey" target="_blank">last year's review</a>, because the same thing happened, except for a different series at Humberto Mauro.
      <br>
      5. <a class="fn" id="fn:5" href="#ref:fn5">&uarr;</a> I rate films according to
      how much I liked them, which I equate to how good they are to me. In the past I
      have tried to be more objective ("I don't like this film but it's good because
      of this and that" etc but I think this is pointless for me, since I approach
      this as a hobby and the rating serves only me, basically). The rating goes
      roughly as
      <center>
        10 - Monumental
        <br>
        9 - Superb
        <br>
        8 - Great
        <br>
        7 - Very good
        <br>
        6 - Good
        <br>
        5 - Meh (aka "very flawed but kinda somewhat nice")
        <br>
        4 - Poor
        <br>
        3 - Bad
        <br>
        2 - Terrible
        <br>
        1 - Unimaginably awful
        <br>
      </center>

      I also use high and low qualifiers (the arrows by the numbers) for ratings below
      10 to further expand the scoring system.

      6. <a class="fn" id="fn:6" href="#ref:fn6">&uarr;</a> I was curious to see
      it when it finally opened in Belo Horizonte, but without too many
      expectations, given the mixed (being generous...) reactions the film
      got. Indeed it's <a href="https://boxd.it/7NeN0J">quite meh</a>. Not
      even being led by Adam Driver, one of my favorite actors, did much for it. Actually, looking at <a href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?year=2013..&actor=adam.driver&singleton=1&sorting=year">Adam Driver's films I've seen</a> (ignoring
      those prior to 2013, in which I don't remember him in), it's interesting,
      there are a few I disliked (<i>Megalopolis</i>, <i>65</i>, <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>)
      but the others, even if if I did not like them much, can be quite
      interesting. But there isn't any that I absolutely love (i.e., from high 8
      upwards), even though there are several that I like a lot, kinda love. Here
      is wishing Adam Driver makes greater films!

      7. <a class="fn" id="fn:7" href="#ref:fn7">&uarr;</a> I guess one can
      imagine why. Those three 2-cinema days in 2020 were all in January and
      February. Between March 2020 and mid-July 2021, I saw two films in a
      cinema. Both in November 2020, when theaters reopened and I risked going
      with a mask on. I decided to not risk it again until I was fully
      vaccinated, which took a while. Feels surreal still to remember the
      pandemic. The <a href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/tenet/">first of those times</a> I
      went in Nov 2020 was to see <i>Tenet</i>. When
      I walked into that movie theater, for the first time in over 8 months, I
      almost cried. Little did I know that the pandemic would still continue to
      heavily affect our lives for years after that.
      <br>
      8. <a class="fn" id="fn:8" href="#ref:fn8">&uarr;</a> Half of those were
      while traveling to Natal, where I spent long periods writing my thesis and
      on vacation in the middle and end of the year. So that schews things a
      bit, as the dynamics are very different when doing a short or long trip,
      or being a work or leisure trip.
      <br>
      9. <a class="fn" id="fn:9" href="#ref:fn9">&uarr;</a> It's the film I've <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?title=fury.road&header=Fury_Road_watches">seen the most</a> in the last ten years.
      <br>
      10. <a class="fn" id="fn:10" href="#ref:fn10">&uarr;</a> It took me so
      long to write this review that as I'm finishing it, on 2025-01-26, I've
      already seen <i>Anora</i>, which I loved but would now rank fourth in
      2024, behind <i>Challengers</i>, <i>The Substance</i>, and <i>Ainda Estou Aqui</i>.
      <br>
      11. <a class="fn" id="fn:11" href="#ref:fn11">&uarr;</a> To a much lesser
      extent, Guadagnino also does this in <i>Queer</i>, his other 2024 film,
      which <a href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/queer-2024/">I quite
      liked</a> overall, but particularly an outstanding scene where Daniel
      Craig shoots heroin to the sound of <i>Leave Me Alone</i>, by New Order.
