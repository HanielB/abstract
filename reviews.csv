Uma coisa que fiquei pensando é em como tanto em Manchester como em Moonlight ter uma ideia melhor do que estava acontecendo me levou a gostar mais do filme. Na primeira vez, em ambos os filmes, eu demorei a perceber qual era o caminho que se seguia. Uma vez com isso claro as coisas se conectam melhor, os detalhes florescem... é bonito de se ver.

2017-02-27,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2016,https://boxd.it/eRckf,1.5,,"Que martírio.

A primeira cena nos apresenta Bruce Wayne durante o evento em que o Superman é apresentado à humanidade (destruindo metade da cidade em uma luta épica do filme anterior). Legal. Essa é a última coisa que faz sentido no filme.

Bruce odeia o Superman (?). O mundo começa a odiar o Superman (??). Lex odeia o Superman (???). O Superman não gosta de ser odiado. A partir dessas premissas as coisas vão acontecendo sem pé nem cabeça, sem qualquer aprofundamento aos personagens ou à forma como seres pensantes lidariam com eventos.

Algumas cenas são especialmente ultrajantes: o disparate que é a reviravolta que sela a luta entre Batman e Superman (é inconcebível, e só isso já justificaria o <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtfoRESVir0"">vídeo do Sad Affleck</a>, but, alas, there's so much more); a cena com Lex Luthor e a Senadora; a cena do deserto (é um ultraje que um filme já excessivamente longo ponha uma cena de 10min que serve unicamente pra criar teorias em trailers e, talvez, fazer referência a filmes que saírão daqui a 5 anos).

Lex Luthor é ridículo. Como disse <a href=""http://m.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2016/03/batman-v-superman-but-its-actually-glengarry-glen-ross-and-they-fight-over-the-good-leads"">certa resenha</a>:

<blockquote>Let's talk about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luther for a second. Eisenberg is a fine actor but his performance in this movie is grating. And it's not just a bad performance. It's a bad performance clearly egged on by misguided direction, combined with thoroughly inane lines. Eisenberg's Luthor is one of those rare characters in the history of cinema you just don't want to see on screen. Whenever he comes on you're gritting your teeth and hoping the frenetic editing will cut to another scene.</blockquote>

Difícil. Além da sequência inicial, o último ato também funciona, já que é uma longa cena de ação sem nenhum grande absurdo. A Mulher Maravilha resolve aparecer, fica legal, o tema dela é empolgante. Aí desistem de lidar com o Superman, matando-o, e em seguida, finalmente, se termina o filme. Ainda bem que tudo na vida é passageiro, até os momentos de sofrimento.","cinema, travel",2016-03-25

2017-03-11,Mulholland Drive,2001,https://boxd.it/fknLf,4.5,,"This movie completely fucked me up.

From the diner scene on... I was always on the edge, expecting anything. If nothing else, that early scene was enough to leave me open and anxious to whatever the film would throw at me.

The thing is that the movie only always got better. From the diner to the seer to the cowboy to Betty's audition to Diane to the theatre to the ordered chaos. And in such a range, with so many different great things in each of these segments.

Naomi Watts is magnificent. She fooled me at first with the innocent girl act, but then there is the audition, then Diane. Oh, man.

And there is the thing about the movie ""making sense"". People seem to care a lot about that, right? I'm with <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/10/08/road-trips"">Anthony Lane</a>:

<blockquote>The question is not “Does 'Mulholland Drive' make sense?,” or even “Is it meant to make sense?,” but, rather, as Laurence Olivier once demanded of Dustin Hoffman, “Is it safe?” If, as happens in the new movie, you come out of the theatre feeling half as secure as you went in, then the mission has been accomplished. All Lynch's work is hit and miss, but, whenever he hits (and I'm not sure that even he knows when, let alone why, he has pulled it off), the role of common sense is flooded and short-circuited by the uncommon gratification of the senses. When David Hockney painted a picture entitled “Mulholland Drive,” he explained that the word “Drive” was “not the name of the road but the act of driving,” and although Lynch's shadow-caked palette could not be more different from Hockney's, his motive is the same. This film is a record of a journey, and it leaves us with the dreadful possibility that all highways are lost.</blockquote>

It's fun to imagine why things happen as they do, what is the hidden meaning and so on... but this is so much <b>less</b> interesting than experiencing what unfolds in front of you in a way that is not dependent on connecting everything instantaneously. That's a different game, a dangerous one, but when it hits, it hits hard.",,2017-03-09

Tinha muito tempo que eu queria ver essa adaptação d'O Iluminado mas hesitava pelo receio de me decepcionar. O que eu tinha ouvido do filme indicava que o seu foco era muito mais na insanidade de Jack Torrance, aparente desde o início, e no seu espetacularismo do que na lenta mas inexorável jornada ao horror e desespero que Stephen King constrói no livro. Some-se a isso o fato de eu idolatrar Kubrick por 2001, Laranja Mecânica e Strangelove (três dos meus filmes favoritos) e não querer ""conspurcar"" a sua imagem com um filme que eu talvez não gostasse tanto.

No fim das contas a experiência foi meio decepcionante, mas definitivamente proveitosa. O filme tem grandes momentos, como todas as cenas em que o foco é Shelley Duvall se desesperando ou as maravilhosas tomadas do hotel ao redor de Jack e Danny. A trilha sonora é magnífica, sendo, junto com Duvall, a principal força por trás da tensão e horror. Porém o produto final parece meio raso. Certamente não chega ao pés do livro, embora fique claro que o filme joga outro jogo, buscando estupefamento mais do que a minuciosa construção do horror.

The first 20 minutes are mesmerizing, greatly setting up the tone and the main character. But then Ashitaka goes into the Deer God's woods and it feels like something slips away. While the wolf and boar gods are tangible and engaging, the Deer God is utterly uninteresting to me. Since so much of the plot revolves around it, including the whole ending sequence, a good part of the film loses its appeal.

And let's talk about that ending. A great thing in this film is how it presents the motivation of its characters. There is no right or wrong, just beings, people or gods, trying to survive. Eboshi is not evil. She is greedy, sure, but destroying the woods is a necessary condition for her's and her people's livelihood. The conflict is only natural, and very well developed. However, the film changes focus towards the last third: Eboshi and Jiko launch themselves into a quest for the Deer God's head, eventually involving all characters in a frenetic race and setting up an apocalyptic chain of events that provides an ending. As the Deer God dies, the woods are reborn, Ashitaka is cured, and no animosity seems to remain between parties. All existing conflicts are resolved in the most unsatisfactory way: by being voided, stripped of their reason to exist.

The rest of the film works somewhat similarly: some inconsequential plot development punctuated by moments of such intensity that you are elated beyond what you thought possible.

It takes its time in setting up the conflicts to come, which ends up leaving you a bit detached at first, but as soon as Gyllenhaal's character leaves, Mulligan goes haywire with such an intensity that you are automatically reimmersed into the narrative. There isn't a more representative moment of the sheer power of Mulligan's performance than the car scene in which she breaks down: ""I feel like I need to wake up,"" to which her son, in horror and disbelief, utters ""mom...?"" She needs to find herself and needs him to witness it, horror show and all. 

The tone changes once Gyllenhaal comes back, with at first explosive but then melancholic resolutions.

2019-01-05,The House That Jack Built,2018,https://boxd.it/BgGbb,3.5,,"Really split over this one. It starts superbly: the initial dialogue hooks you up and the first two incidents, besides being amazing, perfectly place the character, the tone, the point (whether you get it or not; see below), and the aesthetics of the film; the second incident, particularly, is to die for. But then things go astray in the next two incidents.

I hated the third one. It's just uninteresting to watch Jack methodically slaughter his family, I was completely detached (enough to start wondering whether it had been a good idea to watch such an explicit film in the plane; had last thought that with <i>Audition</i>, but it only ever occurred to me afterwards). The whole sequence does not add to the film itself, it just shows the lengths that Jack would go to and how good and invested he got into his craft. The fourth incident then had me weary and at some point thinking ""you know what, Eminem did this little routine (much) better in Kim."" Again it just became something laborious and thankless to go through (the violent climax of the incident was the one point in the movie where I averted my eyes, which was actually pointless since I was not watching the unrated cut that did contain the explicit scene).

The last incident feels like worthwhile progress again. It leads smoothly to a dazzling epilogue and to such a sense of astonishment that you wonder whether it is deserved. Context: I have only watched two von Trier movies: <i>Dogville</i>, which I adore, and <i>Melancholy</i>, which I admire. It did not dawn on me what was <i>really</i> going on until it was hammered into my head by the footage from von Trier's previous films. It had long been clear how meta it was, just not that it was a personification. This casts a new light over the whole enterprise, yes, adding a great deal to how strongly it is imprinted in your mind, but it does not change the fact that a good hour of the movie is ineffective.

I do believe that overall this film is a great accomplishment and I will surely revisit it after I catch up with von Trier's works. It's just that it started so intensely, faded so unceremoniously, then went to such grandiose, that it feels like a hack.","travel, plane",2019-01-02

I liked it a lot, but I was disappointed, mainly for two reasons. The first was that I was certain I'd missed <i>a lot</i> of the film's impact because I did not have the correct background for this, i.e. not being from the USA and not knowing much about the Manson family and related events. In particular I was at a loss with Sharon Tate, which made the whole Margot Robbie subplot a puzzle to me. The other factor was having seen <i>Inglourious Basterds</i>. To <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/gemko/film/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/"">paraphrase Mike D'Angelo</a>, this is the rare film that is spoiled by its director's previous films. As Cliff and Dalton slaughtered the Manson family I was immediately reminded of the ""rewriting history"" ending of <i>Basterds</i>, which significantly softened the blow this time. This is not the kind of stunt you want to pull more than once. And what is worst is that this time it's a much, much better constructed rewriting, while in <i>Basterds</i> it felt borderline pointless.

Disappointments aside, I was mostly delighted with the film. What a ride. Tarantino had me when Cliff drives across town in those mesmerizing shots.  I could have continued to watch Cliff and Dalton for a long time. I really liked the characters and how Pitt and Leo played them. Best moment was Dalton's day at the office, in particular his redemption scene, with that wonderful moment of whispered recognition.

He masterly employs an airtight plot and charismatic characters (minus Chris Evans' one, but that was kind of the point) to pull you into this murder mystery setting and start the best and wilder MacGuffin ride I've seen in a long time. I can go so far as to say it deserves the Built As A Mathematical Proof™ stamp. Just look at that masterpiece of a final shot.

Now, regarding the ""not laughing along"" part... I couldn't disagree more. These were some of the most entertaining and joyous hours I had watching a movie in quite a while. I miss it already.

Luckily Baumbach eventually changed gears and came back with some gut-wrenching scenes, specially towards the end, focusing on Driver and Johansson's highs and lows. I was specially touched by Driver's singing and by his reading of Johansson's letter. Both had an astonishing sense of closure. Their big fight scene though was a little underwhelming to me. It played out as a chaotic culmination of everything we had just watched, however it felt like a <i>non sequitur</i>, given the relative ineffectiveness of the tension build-up we witnessed.

 I liked it more this time around. I was engaged right off the bat this time, liking the beginning throughout, not only its amazing capping by that great bomber scene. Talk about an introduction for Rian Johnson.  I was also more impressed by the other few great scenes, the best one being Snoke's death and its immediate aftermath. The stylistic choices also registered more strongly with me, specially as they differed from the somewhat inert overall stylistic sense this whole franchise has. I wish there was more room to breathe there.  The dominating factor however continues to be that I am deeply annoyed by how the whole movie feels pre-molded and contrived. Hard to recover from that.  

 A curious circumstantial thing for this rewatch was that I did it a day after watching two pictures also featuring Adam Driver: <i>The Report</i> and <i>Marriage Story</i>. He has a very distinguished presence in each of them, which is outstanding given how fundamentally different all three characters are. It is particularly astonishing the contrast of performing Kylo Ren with those two more mature performances.

The sheer inventiveness of The Hand as our hero, its improbable charisma (!), the thrills of the adventure being hammered in by the fantastic score... all marvelous.

The film also does a very good job of intertwining The Hand's adventure with its context, showing us in flashbacks the story of its body, of Naoufel. It is very touching and effective. Naoufel is a less compelling character than The Hand, though, and his pursuit of Gabrielle is a little twisted, but as he seems more misguided than anything the movie still manages to have us rooting for him. Not that it does not seem fitting that he is ultimately rejected, mind you. And that is when the film peaks, just before reconciling the two storylines, which had both been building to a crescendo. In fact the movie had been so good for so long that I was starting to think it might be my favorite of the year so far. But I was worried of the tall order ahead, of how it would provide a climax worthy of its great build up. Well, unfortunately it doesn't.

What is problematic here is the storytelling. Despite being initially intriguing (I knew nothing about this going in, had absolutely no clue what kind of film this was, and the film was very effective in keep me guessing) and taking some impressive unexpected turns, it eventually devolves into a series of contrivances that greatly diminish it, retroactively resignifying previously strong narrative aspects. The biggest example of this is the question of Souleimane's ghost, which not only is a disaster but also spills into Ada's arc, resulting in a very unsatisfying conclusion that feels undeserved, narrative-wise. I also felt the social critique via the worker's ghosts was simplistic, despite being initially jolted by its introduction.

The galaxy has heard a mysterious broadcast, a threat of REVENGE in the sinister voice of the late EMPEROR PALPATINE.  </blockquote> I was not only baffled (as I managed to get here mostly spoiler-free) but also certain that we were in for a ludicrous ride. And ludicrous it was. The whole Palpatine thing is totally nonsensical and uninspired but, worst!, clearly designed to ""reset"" the stakes and undo all the character development that Kylo Ren went through in <i>The Last Jedi</i>. This whole film is dedicated to dealing with the fallout of this decision while hammering in pre-conceived endings, the build up for them be damned, such as Kylo Ren turning, Rey's blood-rights, resistance winning, Poe and Finn not being gay, etc... as well as hooks for next installments. It is <i>exhausting</i>.

The film is so problematic that its highlights come when it assumes an episodic structure as our heroes go from points A to B to C etc in quests that are individually nice, as they are relatively well constructed and introduce new charming characters, but ultimately hollow. As Richard Brody <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/the-robotic-familiarity-of-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker"">put it</a>: <blockquote> The hermetic logic of the plot is as impeccable as it is ridiculous. It’s a drama crafted with robotic insularity for the consumption of viewers being rendered robotic at each moment of the soullessly uniform spectacle.  </blockquote> And these are the nice parts! After that the whole thing devolves into utter ridiculousness as All That Plot™ has to be addressed. It's a total shitshow despite occasional visually arresting moments with emotional highs, which are not properly set up and therefore unearned and infuriating.

After all this I have to say I was really surprised. I really did not expect this level of contrivance, how far they were ready to go to achieve pre-determined goals. I now respect more Rian Johnson for trying to break with these goals and still doing a good job in <i>The Last Jedi</i>, which is a very flawed movie but at least an inspired one, a film that dares to exist on its own. <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> pushes back so strongly against this that it implodes from the very first second. It's despicable. Overall this franchise now feels like an embodiment of the ""D. Sebastião, Rei de Portugal"" poem by Fernando Pessoa (sorry, only Portuguese captures its power):<blockquote>
 Louco, sim, louco, porque quis grandeza<br> Qual a Sorte não dá.  <br> Não coube em mim minha certeza; <br> Por isso onde o areal está <br> Ficou meu ser que houve, não o que há.

Minha loucura, outros que me a tomem <br> Com o que nela ia. <br> Sem a loucura que é o homem <br> Mais que a besta sadia, <br> Cadáver adiado que procria?</blockquote>The worst thing is that the dead body this whole thing now represents is going to spawn many new ones.

Talk about a start for a first-time director, it's mind-boggling. Such was the impact of that scene, specially given how it was filmed and the horror of its sounds, that the rest of the movie felt like a let down. While I cared deeply about Saul and his quest, his insane pursuit of meaning, it just did not reach that same height, felt too conventional. I was more invested in the glimpses we got of the camp and its workings via Saul, as well as in the lengths you are ready to go when you think you are already dead. Ultimately that is the biggest strength of this film: the incredible depiction of a <i>sonderkommando</i>'s day in a concentration camp. A pure nightmare.

Another disappointment for me was how the movie loses momentum towards the end. The revolution-doomed-to-fail plot did not integrate so well into the story and in the end of the day diminished it. I felt like Nemes considered ""Saul's quest"" as not enough of a driving force (accurately, I guess, given what I wrote above) and intertwined it with the revolution, but the integration was too cumbersome for it to really work.

For the longest time it did seem that it would, which was disappointing since this film's journey was far, far less engaging than <i>that</i> one. But the real issue, which became clear later on, was that <i>The Nightingale</i> is not really a ""rape-revenge"" film. It is a film that takes a long, erratic and way too long road to reach its goal: to communicate a much subtler and broader message than initially assumed, a message of fighting against oppression, of freedom, of loving what is yours, what is being taken away by conquerors. In <i>that</i> it excels. Pity it takes so long to get there, but it is worth it. The movie's best moment is its ending: a powerful culmination of the slow build up of its real themes that left me shattered, crying at the forlorn beauty of the songs performed by our wretched heroes.

Thinking about that great ending also reminded me of the song <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T9rplyezcA"">The Clansman</a>, from Iron Maiden, in which I see a similar kind of beauty: <blockquote> They are grinding us down<br> They are taking our land<br> That belongs to the clans<br>(...)<br>No, no, we can't let them take anymore<br> No, we can't let them take anymore<br> We've the land of the free<br><br> Freedom </blockquote>","high, female-director",2020-01-04

I was completely hooked up from that point on, loving how the movie goes on to explore the consequences of that event while at the same time further exploring Iya's life. I was also in love with the acting, narrative, cinematography... all excellent. This is a gorgeous film.

After that first hour however things started to get a bit murky and the movie felt stretched out and overlong. The stakes became less high and I never really bought Iya and Masha's relationship.

This is best illustrated when the film finally finds a good rhythm and then immediately goes nose down into (quite literally) the storm. I was starting to feel the spell cast by Pattinson and Dafoe when suddenly all kinds of (often distracting) hell break loose.

Best scenes for me were the NAKED DAFOE LIGHTHOUSE and PATTINSON BEATS SEAGULL TO A PULP ones.

In the end, even though I liked it, I was greatly disappointed, with a strong feeling of a lost opportunity.

I often got glimpses of a great film here, for instance the marvelous introductions of Jo and Amy, but for the longest time <i>Little Women</i> feels like a checklist, with underdeveloped characters going through the motions, with events that were supposed to be bombastic but whose stakes were never properly set (the most outrageous one being the sick sister plot line, even though that gives us one of the film's most striking scenes, with Jo and Beth in the beach). As I saw others complain, the film seems to require a prior knowledge of the material, without which many scenes seem rushed and a bit pointless. This impacts specially the ""past storyline"", eroding the much more absorbing ""present storyline"", in which the characters were more appealing, the stakes more significant, the actors more, like, in sync (I was baffled to learn mid-film that Amy was supposed to be 13 in the past, which retrospectively explained a behavior that was making me hate a character I assumed was older, which was at odds with ""present Amy"" being probably the strongest presence in the movie, thanks to a marvelous Florence Pugh), and the narrative more interesting and arresting.

When I was ready to consider this a mediocre film though we were given a very strong final stretch by Gerwig.

I have no background whatsoever on Mr. Rogers but I was absolutely entranced by this larger than life yet incredibly grounded individual, beautifully, beautifully played by Hanks. He reminded me of Paddington, as somebody with a firm belief that if you are kind and polite, the world will be right, but also more complex, laborious and aware of his darkness.

The film starts in the most interesting way, unexpectedly (at least to me) handing off, in every aspect including formally, the narrative to an ordinary person, with the implicit promise that somehow his interaction with Rogers will set him on a better path. It's a tall order, and although the film holds up well throughout, it does not quite live up to the intensity of that start. It reads more as a safe, consistent effort with occasional flashes of genius (that moment of silence...). If the main arc was not so unimaginative, relative to everything else, this could have been an absolute emotional juggernaut of a movie. It ended with me wanting numerous sequels, each starting with Mr. Rogers showing a picture of a broken person and proceeding to explore the intersection of their lives.","low, cinema, female-director",2020-01-28

My overall impression is mostly unchanged after a first rewatch, i.e. I still think this is an absolute masterpiece. But only now I noticed how the sudden progressive close-ups amp up the intensity (that first one in the opening sequence!). It's glorious. I also enjoyed more some of the scenes, like the Orpheus and Eurydice story and the confrontation about art and being true to one's self. On the down side some scenes hit me a little less hard this time around, so that I only cried a lot rather than bawled. And I felt like I died and was reborn with <blockquote>J'ai senti, là-bas, cette liberté dont vous m'aviez parlé. Mais j'ai senti aussi, dans cette solitude, que vous me manquiez.</blockquote> It encapsulates the film in so many levels. It's beautiful, heartbreaking and on the nose. The same could be said of the penultimate scene, which I saw many complain of being too heavy handed with the page number in the painting and to whom I say: you are missing the point.

I also wanted to put here what I wrote on a haze the day after I saw this masterpiece for the first time, still inebriated by its genius.

<b>[Written on a haze at 2020/01/14]</b>

That first scene is so crucial. It beautifully introduces the film and, more importantly, sets up the stakes, as we know that a very strong connection will form between Marianne and her muse and it will end in tragedy. It is an incredibly powerful scene hinging on the strong enunciation of one sentence [and, I realized after a rewatch, that close-up]. Magnificent. It's the knowledge we gain here, together with how it's delivered, that throughout the slow burn first half is fundamental to keep us always guessing when the plot is gonna start thickening, so we are never detached from a narrative that could otherwise have lost us. We are left to enjoy the intricacies of an emerging relationship, of the majestic construction of a connection, of the ever more significant gazes. Héloïse's inquiring looks, of someone starving for life. Marianne's looks, of someone striving to capture it.

The second half amps up the intensity with Héloïse accepting to pose after having sparked the creative fire of Marianne. I was a bit apprehensive of the film delivering on the promise at hand, of something greater than ourselves leading to greater art, but there should have been no cause for worry. Sciamma <i>delivers</i>. This is achieved mostly in two arresting scenes. The first is the beautiful chant in the woods with Marianne and Héloïse looking at each other, across the fire, which is all encompassing. It sweeps you away. That definitively forges their bond and takes a hold of us, never to let go. It's fitting that they finally engage in their passion after that. The second scene is the culmination of the abortion subplot. One might have a grudge with that subplot but I was fine with it, it gave a sense of the ordinary to the protagonist's tale, emphasized the need for transgression for women to keep above water, and led to the most creative striking moment for Marianne and Héloïse, which together create, along with Sophie, a proof of their existence, struggle, life. That was when I first broke. From that moment on I was so raw that the minimum things would send me spiraling. And after that what we get is the splendid relationship and then its end. Were that not enough, Sciamma takes us back to the present, right after that first scene, and proceeds to an epilogue of such force that I was completely shattered by its end. The two evocative ways in which she makes Marianne see Héloïse are beautiful, breathtaking, heartbreaking, evocative. The last one is so powerful I could have died there.","cinema, female-director, cried",2020-01-29

Rewatching this film was a perfect and poetic way for me to finish the <i>Retrospectiva Scorsese</i> done by the Cine Humberto Mauro in Belo Horizonte (most of which I missed due to bad work weeks :/). Seeing it on the big screen was much more impactful and arresting than my first watch, consolidating <i>Raging Bull</i> as my favorite Scorsese movie.

This time around I was much more involved in the flow of life the film gets you into. I still think it starts a little lukewarm, that magnificent opening sequence notwithstanding, and that sometimes it could use more stirring, but this is a damn near perfect film. And I love, love, love!, those fighting scenes. Man... they are all encompassing. The photography, the editing, the sound!

Another new aspect for me was actually being aware of the spell cast by Pesci and Moriarty, together with the mesmerizing De Niro. Their apocalyptic slow-burning-discussion-turned-incandescent-all-out-fight is the stuff of heaven. Best scene in the film by far. 

And that brings me to LaMotta. I love how <i>direct</i> Scorsese is in showing the multitudes, the shallowness of LaMotta. Feels almost <i>documental</i>. The telling of his story dwells on both good and bad, on his glory and tragedy, never making you lose sight of his flaws. And at the same time it is always enjoyable.

Then the film started and I was in pure bliss for 5min, completely immersed in Nolan's grandiose cinema, with big images and big sound and impossible stakes. Then everything went dark. Projector problem. We restarted the movie and things were more or less OK for the rest of the screening. Unfortunately, that deflation feeling would return later on, but this time when it became clear that despite all of its qualities <i>Tenet</i> is still a bit of hack.

The move is incomprehensible in such a bad way that it almost feels deliberate. And it's such a non-immersive narrative, told in a straightforward way, that you can't help but try to make sense of what you're watching. Don't get me wrong, I'm the first to sneer at people who complain that a movie is bad because ""it does not make sense"" but this is the kind of film in which your experience is severely affected by the plot. The movie is pretty much the plot. And you cannot follow the plot. As a consequence you cannot follow several scenes that exist mostly to advance the plot.

So I'm really glad that Grady Hendrix, in his interview for the NEW KOREAN CINEMA collection on the Criterion Channel, said he considers this the best Park Chan-wook (!!), which automatically made me want to see it for myself. I don't agree it's the best (I love <i>Oldboy</i> and <i>The Handmaiden</i> way more), but it's goddamn awesome.

The movie does not have the visual flair that I learned to associate with Park Chan-wook, but it does have his dazzling storytelling skills and deep character connections. I was completely sold on the relationship between the soldiers, on the acting of Sang Kang-ho and Lee Byung-hun, on the tragedy of it all. What a stupid world. And the final strike to move me to tears was the amazing depiction of that picture. Magnificent.

Some notes:

- I don't think that the investigator really worked as a character though. I also did not like much Soo-hyeck's suicide. It was a strangely flat moment.

Unfortunately this peaks early. There are other incredibly stylish (everything here is about style and maximum impact) and arresting scenes but it does wear off a bit.

Overall the biggest quality of the film is its thoroughly overwhelming and unrelenting narrative. It's balls-to-the-walls storytelling. Completely effective in portraying a man and his folly.

Also loved the scene in which the mayor attacks Kane and his folly. As the mayor says:
<blockquote> You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane. If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you. Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson.  </blockquote>
Rings true and too close to home. Beware of folly.

The film deflates a bit towards the end. Susan's part of the story feels less compelling, maybe because by that point Kane was already mostly a shell.

And for me to remember, as I had completely forgotten this, the rosebud stuff is a symbol of sentiment. Kane lived his life without it. He shows emotions twice: when he's a kid being abandoned and when he's an old man being abandoned.

This time I accepted that it makes no sense to hold the film accountable for its stupid premise. The movie is incredibly effective in taking said premise and running with it. We are treated to a festival of amazing scenes and shockingly over-the-top characters. The fight scene with the masked guards in particular is so astonishing that it made me instantly realize how great this film is and how dense I had been the first time watching it.

The film works very very well. Gets a bit messy towards the end, as if Sciamma did not quite know how to deal with Vic once separated from the <i>bande de filles</i>, but she still ends it with a marvelous (if easy to anticipate) and hopeful shot.

As an aside, I finally completed Sciamma's filmography with this one, which I really wanted to do after being blown away by <i>Portrait de la Jeune Fille en Feu</i> in the beginning of the year.

Ultimately this treasure of a film is focused on capturing that incredible feeling of losing yourself to music together with a crowd (a sentiment that I lived for for a good chunk of my life, so it hits very close to home). There is a nice romance and some tangential storylines intertwined but these are distractions from the real substance here, which is people reacting to music and each other enjoying it.

The main issue of the film is its somewhat weak immersiveness. One often enjoys the film merely intellectually.

I also disliked a bit the Bus Boy subplot. It was the one contrived element of the film, even though it provides one of its most touching scenes, with Skylar's sacrifice and Autumn's acknowledgment.

Big drop since my first watch.

But I often failed to connect to the film, specially through the first half. It only really got going for me when Sadness (both the character and the mood) started to dominate, which is around the part when Bing Bong cries and she talks to him. Only then it went from ""what a nice series of facts"" to ""what an interesting film.""

BTW Bing Bong actually is the one character of this movie that I could really connect to, as the other characters mostly feel like transparent vessels for conveying the filmmakers' vision. I didn't like every Bing Bong moment, but when I did though it was devastating. Sadness talking to him on the cliff and his sacrifice are my favorite moments of the film, the second one in particular, which completely overwhelmed me.

Still very much love this film. This time around I think I can pinpoint where it loses me: part 5 is a drag, breaks the rhythm (which does hold pretty well at part 4) and does no favor to part 6, which is itself not that effective.

After that start things slowly fall into place. You get what they're getting at. I loved it. It's a big roller-coaster, with many things falling flat and many hitting the mark splendidly.

And I should say that Marion Cotillard did not captivate me much but Adam Driver did, more than enough for them both. And Simon Helberg's main scene is maybe the best after the start.

My favorite part of the film actually happens less than halfway through:
<blockquote>
- What is it, George? 
- Oh, I just wanted to say how nice it is not to be alone.</blockquote>Everything that had happened up to that point had perfectly set up that moment for maximum impact. Glorious.

At times it even feels redundant. Other than that I was also really put off by the ending. It felt unearned, with Leda getting a moment of peace and closure out of nowhere.

I also really liked <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/maggie-gyllenhaals-the-lost-daughter-is-sluggish-spotty-and-a-major-achievement/amp"">Richard Brody's review</a>, in which he also emphasizes dissonance of the parallel stories but more importantly elucidates how the lack of a crucial detail from the novel (that Leda and the loud family come from the same region) makes it confusing both Leda's unconscious hostility toward them and her repulsion to leave her daughters with her mother when she leaves.
