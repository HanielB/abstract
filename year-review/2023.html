            <br>

            <p>I love watching films, but I also love collecting data about my
            movie-watching and looking at it, computing fun things about it,
            etc. It makes me reminisce about all the great films I've seen and
            the wonder of it all.</p>

            <p>Here I'll summarize some of the data analysis stuff for 2023 as
            well as look into the films I watched in 2023 that I loved the
            most. It's the first time I'm writing such a review and let's see
            how it goes.</p>
            
            <p>2023 has been a great year film-wise for me. There were many
            great movies released and I also saw many, many old great films for
            the first time. Also I never saw so many <i>filminhos</i> (just a
            few more than in 2017, the previous top year<a class="ref"
            id="ref:fn0" href="#fn:0"><sup>[0]</sup></a>), and, specially, never
            saw so many in movie theaters (70! It had never been more than 40
            before). I was also happy that I managed to write a bit my
            impressions about almost all the films that I saw, a good indicator
            that I did not have long "outage" stretches where I did not have the
            energy to timely log and write about the films I was watching (there
            were a few of these outages, but I generally recovered in time to
            still write about them).</p>

            <h2>The Journey</h2>

            <p>The overview of my movie watching in 2023 is summarized in the
              plot<a class="ref" id="ref:fn1" href="#fn:1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> below. The
            green bars are for films watched in a cinema.  In the X axis by the
            names of the months are the number of watched films in that month,
            with the max and min months in bold.</p>

            <br>
            <span><img src="./images/2023/2023.png"  class="img-responsive" style="width: 100%"/></span>
            <br>
            
            <p>I started strong in January (consistently a strong month for me)
              with 28 films (second-best only to January 2019, when I saw 33
              films<a class="ref" id="ref:fn2" href="#fn:2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>!)
              and kept a good average through April: about 3 movies/week after
              Jan, with the average sitting close to 4 by the end of
              April. Generally my goal is to see about 4 movies a week on
              average, so it was going great.</p>

            <p>Then came what I'll call the <i>DARPA months</i>, when at work
            (see my <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/">work page</a>) I was
            writing <i>two</i> project proposals in a call
            by <a target="_blank" href="">DARPA</a>, which was much more work than I anticipated
            and kinda took over my life, to great personal suffering, of which
            me watching only 9 films in <i>two months</i> is but a symptom (one
            of the proposals got through, at least!).</p>

            <p>I bounced back in July greatly helped<a class="ref" id="ref:fn3"
                                                       href="#fn:3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
              by a big sci-fi series ran by
              the <a target="_blank" href="https://fcs.mg.gov.br/espacos-culturais/palacio-das-artes/cine-humberto-mauro/">Cine
                Humberto Mauro</a> in Belo Horizonte, with a lot of old favorites of

              mine. I kept the momentum in early August helped by vacation and
              that continued as I went back to work, thanks to more free time
              for movies available due to my wife going abroad for the rest of
              the year and for three months without traveling for
              me<a class="ref" id="ref:fn4"
              href="#fn:4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. From July through November my
              weekly average was 5.22, my highest ever 5-month average!
            </p>

            <p>The year wrapped with a lot of travel and less movies watched,
            but I took advantage of a week home in mid-December to catch-up on
            films that were in theaters and an Ozu series going on at Cine
            Humberto Mauro. It's been wonderful. Here
            are <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2023&header=Films_watched_in_2023">all
            the films I saw in 2023</a>.</p>

            <br>
            
            <p>This year I discovered a new cinema in Belo Horizonte (it opened
            midway through 2022 and I didn't know), which is part
            of <a target="_blank"
            href="https://minastenisclube.com.br/cultura/centro-cultural-unimed-bh-minas/">Centro
            Cultural Unimed-BH Minas</a> and has great (i.e., not like the
            mainstream-restricted cinemas in shopping malls) programming. Early
            in 2023 they did sort of a "best of 2022" series, which had my two
            favorites films from 2021: <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/sv94"><i>Drive my Car</i></a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/iwtE"><i>Memoria</i></a>,
            respectively
            (impressions <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/drive-my-car/3/">here</a>
            and <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/memoria-2011/1/">here</a>).</p>

            <p>It was a delight to see them again in a movie theater and to get to
            know this new venue in BH. BTW these are all the movies I saw there
            this
              year: <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2023&tags=cinema;minas&header=Films_watched_at_Minas_cinema_in_2023">link</a>.</p>

            <h3>Rewatching <span class="italic">Portrait de la Jeune Fille en Feu</span> in its Criterion edition</h3>

            <br>
            <center>
              <span><img src="./images/2023/portrait.png"  class="singlecard"/></span>
            </center>
            <br>
            
            In 2023 I started a journey of collecting films in blu-ray<a class="ref" id="ref:fn5" href="#fn:5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.
            I went to the US in February and took the opportunity to buy some
            editions from the Criterion Collection, among them one of my
            favorite films ever: <a target="_blank"
            href="https://boxd.it/jkPq"><i>Portrait de la Jeune Fille en
            Feu</i></a>. The edition is <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.criterion.com/films/30469-portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire">beautiful</a>
            and it was a <a target="_blank"
            href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire/2/">delight
            to watch it</a>. I had been afraid that I might not like it as much
            watching at home, after having only seen it in theaters, but that was
            foolish of me. The power of this film cannot be contained.

            <h3><span class="italic">2001</span> in a cinema</h3>

            <br>
            <center>
              <span><img src="./images/2023/2001.png"  class="singlecard"/></span>
            </center>
            <br>

            One of the films in the sci-fi series by Cine Humberto Mauro
            was <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/2bf0">2001</a>, another
            of my favorite films ever. I had seen it in a cinema for the first
            time in <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/zA6kX">2018 at Iowa City</a>, and
            that was pure bliss. I was thrilled to get to see it again in a
            cinema and,
            again, <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/2001-a-space-odyssey/1/">it
            was pure bliss</a>. But for the first time the film made me cry. I
            really felt for HAL.
            
            <h3><span class="italic">Oppenheimer</span> in 70mm</h3>

            <br>
            <center>
              <span><img src="./images/2023/oppie.png"  class="singlecard"/></span>
            </center>
            <br>
            
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/wUow">Oppenheimer</a> was
            the first film I ever watched in 70mm! I had a work trip to
            Norway in July and took the opportunity<a class="ref" id="ref:fn6"
            href="#fn:6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> to see it in Oslo on the way back
            home. With the release of <i>Oppenheimer</i> and the hype around the
            film's format I learned more about the whole thing with formats,
            film vs digital etc, and I was really hooked-up on the idea of
              watching something in 70mm film for the first time.</p>

            <p>It was a great experience, starting with the theater: I saw it in
            the Oslo Cinemateket, a beautiful place. I
            absolutely <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/4CBqLv">loved the film</a> and
            regarding the format at first I did not really notice anything in
            particular, but in time I became conscious of how every shot was
              impressive, merely by means of being there.</p>

            <p>I'd end up
            watching <i>Oppenheimer</i> <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?title=oppenheimer&watched=2023&header=Oppenheimer_in_2023">four
            times in theaters</a>, the other times not in 70mm but at least in
            digital IMAX, which actually had better sound. The last time I saw
            it I even bumped the rating to low 9, and it currently sits second
            place in my <a href="#best">Best of 2023</a> list.</p>

            <p>Funnily enough, this was also the 100th film I watched in 2023. The
            only time I was faster to reach 100 watched films in a year was in
            2019 (a year in which I kept a 5 movie/week average through June
            before being totally derailed by traveling for work and moving
              countries).</p>

            <h3><span class="italic">The Grand Budapest Hotel</span> in a cinema</h3>

            <br>
            <center>
              <span><img src="./images/2023/budapest.png"  class="singlecard"/></span>
            </center>
            <br>

            <p>Another great series that Cine Humberto Mauro ran in 2023 was a
            Wes Anderson retrospective. I took the opportunity to
            watch <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/2aqw">The Life Aquatic with Steve
            Zissou</a> for the first time
            (and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/4L0krL">loved it</a>) and to
            rewatch <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/3ZqO">The Grand Budapest Hotel</a>
            and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/dZrW">Isle of Dogs</a>. The latter
            I <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/isle-of-dogs-2018/1/">quite
            liked again</a>, but the former
            I <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/the-grand-budapest-hotel/1/">loved
            much, much more than I had before</a>. It is such a
            beautiful, <i>funny</i>, carefully constructed film. Seeing it in
            the big screen played a factor also, I believe.
            </p>

            <p>Overall 2023
                was <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2023&director=wes.anderson&header=Wes_Anderson_in_2023">The
                Year Of Wes Anderson</a> for me: I watched his
                films <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2023&tags=cinema&director=wes.anderson&header=Wes_Anderson_in_theaters_in_2023">seven
                times in a cinema</a> and absolutely
                loved <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/Is80">The Swan</a>
                and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/s3ds">Asteroid City</a> (currently
                third and fourth in my <a href="#best">Best of 2023</a> list).
            </p>

            <h3><span class="italic">Oldboy</span> in a cinema</h3>

            <br>
            <center>
              <span><img src="./images/2023/oldboy.png" class="doublecard"/></span>
            </center>
            <br>

            Another of my favorite films. I was thrilled when the 4K re-release
            of <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/29R2">Oldboy</a> was
            announced and even more so when I realized that it'd show in cinemas in
            Belo Horizonte. I went twice (thoughs of
            the <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/oldboy/1/">first
            time</a>, thoughts of
            the <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/oldboy/2/">second
            time</a>) and it was everything I could have hoped for. Perfect
            cinema.
            
            <h3><span class="italic">Memories of Murder</span> in its Criterion edition</h3>

            <br>
            <center>
              <span><img src="./images/2023/memories.png"  class="singlecard"/></span>
            </center>
            <br>

            <p>I
            love <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?header=Bong_Joon-ho&director=bong.joon-ho&sorting=year&singleton=1&watchlist=1&available=yes">Bong
            Joon-ho</a> and my favorite of his films already was <a target="_blank"
            href="https://boxd.it/1TSo">Memories of Murder</a> before I set to
            rewatch it in
            the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.criterion.com/films/31458-memories-of-murder">gorgeous
            Criterion edition</a>. I had the time of my life. The quality of
            image and sound was astonishing. Perfect cinema. Insane that both
            this film and <i>Oldboy</i> were made and released at roughly the
              same time in South Korea.</p>

            <p>One of the side effects of
            the <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/4XYlgx">transcendent experience</a> I
            had rewatching <i>Memories of Murder</i> in its Criterion edition
            was that it completely converted me into a believer in physical
            media not only for collecting but also (and now specially) to have
            the maximum possibility quality of image and sound for film watching
            (at home), and it led me to start buying blu-rays also of films
            outside the Criterion Collection.</p>

            <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

            <ul>
            <li>One thing I tried in 2023 was to reduce the overwhelming
            dominance of US films<a class="ref" id="ref:fn7"
            href="#fn:7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> in my movie watching. Historically
            it has been close to 70%! In 2023 it ended up being 58% (118/204),
            my lowest ever, so that was nice. On the other hand, I tried to up
            the percentage of Brazilian films and that basically failed, with
            only 4.5% (9/204) of the total (which is sadly a record
            though).</li>

            <li>In 2023 I watched 24 films directed by women, another sad
              record. Something else to improve this year.</li>

            <li>I watched 9 films in planes, second to 10 in 2018. I never flew
            as much as in 2023, but that was also the year I got into movie
            podcasts and I listened to them a lot in flights, so that's probably
              why I didn't top 2018.</li>

            <li>I never saw so many films in IMAX (all of them digital,
            unfortunately) as in
            2023. I <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2023&tags=imax&header=IMAX_in_2023">went
            12 times</a>, compared to only 3 times in 2022. It is always worth
              it because the sound is so much better than in any other theater.</li>

            <li><p>In 2023 there were 39 days (generally in the weekends) in which
            I watched at least 2 films, 11 of which were 3-films days. In 2022
                there were 26 2-films days, and only three 3-films days.</p>

              <p>Yearly my average of 2-films days is about 30, so 2023 was
            an outlier, together with 2017, which had 37 of them. That was also
                a very strong year, movie-watching-wise.</p>

              <p>Overall I've had four 4-films days:
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=20171022&header=Films_seen_in_2017-10-22">2017-10-22</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=20190105&header=Films_seen_in_2019-01-05">2019-01-05</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=20190112&header=Films_seen_in_2019-01-12">2019-01-12</a>,
                  and the single 5-films
                  day <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=20180303&header=Films_seen_in_2018-03-03">2018-03-03</a>.

 </li>

            <li>I love the Criterion Channel with all my heart and in 2023 I was
            committed to watch more movies in it. That worked well, and I ended
            up watching 42 films (21% of my movie total), the previous maximum
            (the service started in 2020) being 28 in 2020 (20% of the total, in
              a slow year).

              I tried to lean more in their special series and I particularly
              liked their <i>'70s Car Movies</i> series. I like car
              movies<a class="ref" id="ref:fn8" href="#fn:8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
              and that series had sereval I did not previously know. There were
              some duds but overall it was quite fun.</li>

            <li>One of the things I wanted to do in 2023 was to go through the
            films available in the Criterion Channel of
            the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/greatest-films-all-time">Sight
            and Sound 2022 list</a> of the greatest films of all time. Of
            the <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/list/criterion-channels-selection-from-sight-and/">52
            films available</a> (out of 250 in the list) in the beginning of the
            year, I had before 2023 seen only 11, and I managed to see only
            <a target="_blank"

            more</a>. The first three of those I was actually a bit mixed on,

            <p>I like compiling the list of my favorite first watches of older
            films because there is so much I'm still catching up with and it can
              be so cathartic to discover these films.</p>

            <p>No first watches in
            2023 were more impressive for me
            than <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-celebration/">Festen</a>,
            an outrageously funny, deeply disturbing, magistral film;
            and <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/film/tokyo-story/">Tokyo
            Story</a>, an irresistible film of such beauty and disarming
            sensibility that it
            left <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/tokyo-story/">completely
                devastated</a>.</p>

            <p>In a sense both <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/1vYs">Irma Vep</a>
            and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/18Im">The Graduate</a> were revelations

            and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/4GIy9J">here</a>). The other movies in
            the list are all somewhat haunting and striking, except
            for <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/bk7W">Certain Women</a>, which is
            wonderful, beautiful, and had the great distinction of introducing

            <h2>Best of 2023</h2>

            <p style="font-size: small"><b>Note</b>: As of 2023-01-05. The list will probably change as a I catch-up with some 2023 films I've not had a chance yet to see (<i>Past Lives</i>, <i>May December</i>, <i>The Zone of Interest</i> etc). The list in <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?list=2023best">this link</a> is kept up to date.</p>

            <p>These are the best films from 2023 that I have seen, at the time
            of this writing. A really strong year, comparing with 2022, where my
            two favorites (here is a
            <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?list=2022best">top
            10</a>), the all-encompassing <i>RRR</i> and the beautiful,
            beautiful <i>Aftersun</i>, were the only high 8's of the year, and
            there were no 9's. The year of 2023 has been comparable with 2021, a
            great year coming back from the similarly weak 2020,
            where <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?list=2021best">my
            favorites</a> were in a similar standing with ratings, but 2023 was
            more prolific in having films I <i>really like</i> (from high 7
            up).</p>

            <ol reversed>
              <li><b>Godzilla Minus One (2023, JP)</b></li>

              A great time at the movies, and the last film I saw in IMAX in
              2023. I <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/godzilla-minus-one/">really
              liked the film</a> and its balance between drama and action that
              manages to involve us in the story, creating the necessary stakes
              for the (amazing, brutal) spectacle it provides. I also loved the
              soundtrack, to which I've been listening to very often since then
              (in fact, listening to it as I'm writing this).

              <li><b>Retratos Fantasmas (2023, BR)</b></li>

              A personal love story for one's own obsessions and the places
              where we belong. Touching and
              beautiful. It <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/pictures-of-ghosts/">hit
              me hard</a>. It was a joy to see it in a street cinema in Belo
              Horizonte, as it should be.

              <li><b>Passages (2023, FR)</b></li>

              A film that stayed with me since
              it <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/passages-2023/">swept
              me away</a>. I loved walking home from the theater while
              reminiscing the film, thinking of Tomas riding his bike through
              Paris, forced to live with himself. It's a film that talks about
              the chaos of our lives and is very striking in no small part
              because of the leads, which are all amazing, with performances
              that I often catch myself thinking of.

              <li><b>Anatomie d'une chute (2023, FR)</b></li>

              <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/anatomy-of-a-fall/">Another
              film</a> that stayed with me, thanks specially to the tenderness
              of the kid's performance who has the most heartbreaking scene of
              the film. Also, the first Palm d'Or I truly loved
              since <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/D7vj9">Shoplifters</a>, in 2018
              (which was
              actually <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?list=2018best">my
              favorite film of that year</a>),
              and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/VmieR">Parasite</a> in 2019.

              <li><b>Monster (2023, JP)</b></li>

              And speaking of Kore-eda, what an absolute delight is to watch his
              films. I had not watched anything from him since the
              aforementioned <i>Shoplifters</i> in 2019, so it was great to see
              both <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/rDUU">Broker</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/DJEM">Monster</a>
              in 2023. I <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/480nXz">liked the former</a>,
              but the latter... it is only rated low 8 because I disliked a
              significant chunk of it, but what I liked
              I <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/monster-2023/"><i>absolutely
              loved</i></a>. The absolute devastating ending has some subjective
              elements that make me really want to revisit the film.

              <li><b>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023, US)</b></li>

              Now we get to high 8's up territory<a class="ref" id="ref:fn10"
              href="#fn:10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>, where almost all is forgiven
              given the sheer power of the film in front of me
              (lol). As <i>Across the Spider-Verse</i> unfolded I got a bit
              afraid it'd be one of the greatest films I ever saw (I was truly
              <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse/">floored
              by its first segment</a>), but things calmed down a bit. Amazing
              film that is only really hurt by not being a full film.

              <li><b>Shin Kamen Rider (2023, JP)</b></li>

              Utter shock. That's what comes to mind when I remember this
              film. I can still hardly believe that it manages to do what it
              does. A unique, astonishing film, that
              I <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/shin-kamen-rider/">poorly
              tried to describe</a> when I saw it. Just watch it. But play it
              <i>loud</i>. This film <i>demands</i> it.

              <li><b>John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023, US)</b></li>

              The first film in this list that I saw in 2023. I was already sure
              in March, when I first saw it, that would be in this list. It's such an amazing film. I rewatched the John Wick
              series coming in to this one and I was skeptical
              after <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/42bijx">John Wick 3</a> that this
              one would be anything beyond a nice film. Well, I was happily
              proven wrong. I particularly loved how sound is used in the
              film. <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/42AZRd">Loved, loved it</a>.

              <li><b>Asteroid City (2023, US)</b></li>

              As I mentioned, 2023 for was for me the Year of Wes Anderson and
              his new feature was <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/4CBbmZ">at first
              elusive</a> for me (rated <i>only</i> high 7, lol), but it shot up
              to high 8 as <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/4LM3zp">I rewatched it</a>
              and stayed there when I saw it <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/4PrzNR">a
              third time</a>. It particularly spoke to me in my struggle feeling
              overwhelmed in 2023 and trying to carry on, to make it work even
              though I don't understand the play.

              <li><b>The Swan (2023, US)</b></li>

              Now this thing made something new for me: to rate a
              short. Normally I would not even log short films, but the series
              of shorts that Wes Anderson made in 2023 forced me to reconsider
              this. They have a unique artistry, identity, and, most importantly
              (to the purposes of this whole exercise), had a distinct impact on
              me. So I made peace with logging shorts<a class="ref"
              id="ref:fn11" href="#fn:11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> and went further
              with <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/film/the-swan-2023/">The
              Swan</a>, a masterpiece. Given the whole situation, a bit afraid
              to revisit it though.

              <li><b>Oppenheimer (2023, US)</b></li>

              As I said in the highlights, I loved this film to the point of
            watching it <a target="_blank"
            href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?title=oppenheimer&watched=2023&header=Oppenheimer_in_2023">four
            times in theaters</a>. If it was still in theaters I'd watch it
            again
            tomorrow. I <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?header=Christopher_Nolan&director=christopher.nolan&sorting=year&singleton=1&watchlist=1&available=yes">love
            Nolan</a> and <i>Oppenheimer</i> is him at his best for building an
            irresistible narrative, filming gorgeously and adding killer sound. The
            tragedy of Oppenheimer the character was also very relatable to me,
            given the academic context and all. And the ending always breaks me.

              <li><b>Killers of the Flower Moon (2023, US)</b></li>

              My favorite film of 2023 is also the one I had the most
              expectations before going in to see. I have watched <i>a
              lot</i> of
              Scorsese <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2019..&director=scorsese&header=Scorsese_films_seen_since_2019">in
              the last few years</a> and have therefore grown to love him. Him being a champion of cinema of course helps. Fact is
              that <i>Killers of the Flower
              Moon</i> <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/524ZHB">delivered</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/53j1Oh">again</a>
              and <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/5fkF31">again</a>, a magnificent
              experience. Sad, devastating, and magical. May Scorsese live
              forever.
            </ol>

            And that's it. This year review ended up much bigger than I expected,
            what makes me afraid of managing to do it in the next years, but I
            guess the harder part was defining the structure I wanted and the
            HTML, CSS etc of it all. I liked doing it, so that's what
            matters. I hope that 2024 will be an equally great year
            for <i>filminhos</i> and for my movie watching, let's see!

0. <a class="fn" id="fn:0" href="#ref:fn0">&uarr;</a> I started seriously collecting data on my movie watching in 2015, so that's when history starts.
<br>
1.  <a class="fn" id="fn:1" href="#ref:fn1">&uarr;</a> The bars equate the number of movies watched in the respective week, and I define a week as starting on Mondays. Week 1 of 2023 is the week starting on the first day of 2023 that is a Monday. Thus, since 2023-01-01 was a Sunday, the plot has to include the last week of 2022, of which that Sunday was a part of. But only the films watched in the 2023 part of that week, i.e., on 2023-01-01, are represented in the plot. Week 1 starts on 2023-01-02, as expected.
<br>
2.  <a class="fn" id="fn:2" href="#ref:fn2">&uarr;</a> Probably thanks to an
              absolute awful winter that I spent alone in Iowa City, including a
              three-day period with -50°C!
<br>
3.  <a class="fn" id="fn:3" href="#ref:fn3">&uarr;</a> Besides the end of the DARPA
            crunch as well as the end of the teaching semester at UFMG.
<br>
4.  <a class="fn" id="fn:4" href="#ref:fn4">&uarr;</a> 2023 was a crazy year for me, traveling-wise. I spent 46 days away from home for work trips and 48 days in personal trips.

<br>
5.  <a class="fn" id="fn:5" href="#ref:fn5">&uarr;</a> I got carried away and <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/list/films-i-have-in-physical-media/">these are all the films</a> I have gotten in 2023 (up to <i>Interstellar</i>). I started to get not only Criterion editions when I realized the big difference in quality that physical media provides, that I have no reasonable way of reproducing.

<br>
6.  <a class="fn" id="fn:6" href="#ref:fn6">&uarr;</a> Alas, there are no
commercial cinemas in Brazil anymore showing films actually on film, let alone
in 70mm or in IMAX 70mm. 

<br>
7. <a class="fn" id="fn:7" href="#ref:fn7">&uarr;</a> It is actually tricky to
determine where a film "is from." If you take how Letterboxd does it, it lists
the countries of a film based on the production companies involved in producing
the film; all of them, indiscriminately. That will not do. I've decided to go
the same way as the Academy of Motion Pictures goes, for films competing in the
international category: "The submitting country must confirm that creative
control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens or residents of the
submitting country" (I only looked up this definition when writing this overview
though, so we are only retroactively in sync, lol). So what I did was go through
every film I watched since 2015 and tag them with the one country I think had
the creative control, broadly defined (generally what country was most involved
in the production and, if that was not very clear, where the creators of the
film are from). It is a bit unsatisfactory sometimes to have only one country
listed though, so I may revisit that in the future.
<br>
8. <a class="fn" id="fn:8" href="#ref:fn8">&uarr;</a> Letterboxd tells me the
most common "movie theme" for me in 2023
was <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/films/diary/for/2023/mini-theme/car-cars-racing-speed-adrenaline/by/date/">"Adrenaline-Fueled
  Action And Fast Cars"</a>, lol. Although only <i>Le Mans</i> is actually from the Criterion Channel series.

<br>
9. <a class="fn" id="fn:9" href="#ref:fn9">&uarr;</a> I rate films according to
how much I liked them, which I equate to how good they are to me. In the past I
have tried to be more objective ("I don't like this film but it's good because
of this and that" etc but I think this is pointless for me, since I approach
this as a hobby and the rating serves only me, basically). The rating goes
roughly as
<center>
10 - Monumental
<br>
9 - Superb
<br>
8 - Great
<br>
7 - Very good
<br>
6 - Good
<br>
5 - Meh (aka "very flawed but kinda somewhat nice")
<br>
4 - Poor
<br>
3 - Bad
<br>
2 - Terrible
<br>
1 - Unimaginably awful
<br>
</center>

I also use high and low qualifiers (the arrows by the numbers) for ratings below
10 to further expand the scoring system.
<br>
10. <a class="fn" id="fn:10" href="#ref:fn10">&uarr;</a> I started using "high"
and "low" qualifiers in 2020, and ever since only 15% of the films I rate have
had that rating or higher. That number is a bit skewed though because of the older
movies I'm ever catching up with (and they invariably have a higher selection
bias). Considering only films from 2018 on, the percentage is actually only 11%.
<br>
11. <a class="fn" id="fn:11" href="#ref:fn11">&uarr;</a> I will still take it
one short at a time... I saw <i>Civic</i> the other day and did not log it, for
example, since I don't think it left a proper impression on me to justify
it. But <i>Black Panthers</i> did, so that I'll log... still unhappy about this
lack of clear criteria though.
