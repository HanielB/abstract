            0. <a class="fn" id="fn:0" href="#ref:fn0">&uarr;</a> I started seriously collecting data on my movie watching in 2015, so that's when history starts.
            <br>
            1.  <a class="fn" id="fn:1" href="#ref:fn1">&uarr;</a> The bars equate the number of movies watched in the respective week, and I define a week as starting on Mondays. Week 1 of 2023 is the week starting on the first day of 2023 that is a Monday. Thus, since 2023-01-01 was a Sunday, the plot has to include the last week of 2022, of which that Sunday was a part of. But only the films watched in the 2023 part of that week, i.e., on 2023-01-01, are represented in the plot. Week 1 starts on 2023-01-02, as expected.
            <br>
            2.  <a class="fn" id="fn:2" href="#ref:fn2">&uarr;</a> Probably thanks to an
            absolute awful winter that I spent alone in Iowa City, including a
            three-day period with -50Â°C!
            <br>
            3.  <a class="fn" id="fn:3" href="#ref:fn3">&uarr;</a> Besides the end of the DARPA
            crunch as well as the end of the teaching semester at UFMG.
            <br>
            4.  <a class="fn" id="fn:4" href="#ref:fn4">&uarr;</a> 2023 was a crazy year for me, traveling-wise. I spent 46 days away from home for work trips and 48 days in personal trips.

            <br>
            5.  <a class="fn" id="fn:5" href="#ref:fn5">&uarr;</a> I got carried away and <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/list/films-i-have-in-physical-media/">these are all the films</a> I have gotten in 2023 (up to <i>Interstellar</i>). I started to get not only Criterion editions when I realized the big difference in quality that physical media provides, that I have no reasonable way of reproducing.

            <br>
            6.  <a class="fn" id="fn:6" href="#ref:fn6">&uarr;</a> Alas, there are no
            commercial cinemas in Brazil anymore showing films actually on film, let alone
            in 70mm or in IMAX 70mm.

            <br>
            7. <a class="fn" id="fn:7" href="#ref:fn7">&uarr;</a> It is actually tricky to
            determine where a film "is from." If you take how Letterboxd does it, it lists
            the countries of a film based on the production companies involved in producing
            the film; all of them, indiscriminately. That will not do. I've decided to go
            the same way as the Academy of Motion Pictures goes, for films competing in the
            international category: "The submitting country must confirm that creative
            control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens or residents of the
            submitting country" (I only looked up this definition when writing this overview
            though, so we are only retroactively in sync, lol). So what I did was go through
            every film I watched since 2015 and tag them with the one country I think had
            the creative control, broadly defined (generally what country was most involved
            in the production and, if that was not very clear, where the creators of the
            film are from). It is a bit unsatisfactory sometimes to have only one country
            listed though, so I may revisit that in the future.
            <br>
            8. <a class="fn" id="fn:8" href="#ref:fn8">&uarr;</a> Letterboxd tells me the
            most common "movie theme" for me in 2023
            was <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/films/diary/for/2023/mini-theme/car-cars-racing-speed-adrenaline/by/date/">"Adrenaline-Fueled
                Action And Fast Cars"</a>, lol. Although only <i>Le Mans</i> is actually from the Criterion Channel series.

            <br>
            9. <a class="fn" id="fn:9" href="#ref:fn9">&uarr;</a> I rate films according to
            how much I liked them, which I equate to how good they are to me. In the past I
            have tried to be more objective ("I don't like this film but it's good because
            of this and that" etc but I think this is pointless for me, since I approach
            this as a hobby and the rating serves only me, basically). The rating goes
            roughly as
            <center>
                10 - Monumental
                <br>
                9 - Superb
                <br>
                8 - Great
                <br>
                7 - Very good
                <br>
                6 - Good
                <br>
                5 - Meh (aka "very flawed but kinda somewhat nice")
                <br>
                4 - Poor
                <br>
                3 - Bad
                <br>
                2 - Terrible
                <br>
                1 - Unimaginably awful
                <br>
            </center>

            I also use high and low qualifiers (the arrows by the numbers) for ratings below
            10 to further expand the scoring system.
            <br>
            10. <a class="fn" id="fn:10" href="#ref:fn10">&uarr;</a> I started using "high"
            and "low" qualifiers in 2020, and ever since only 15% of the films I rate have
            had that rating or higher. That number is a bit skewed though because of the older
            movies I'm ever catching up with (and they invariably have a higher selection
            bias). Considering only films from 2018 on, the percentage is actually only 11%.
            <br>
            11. <a class="fn" id="fn:11" href="#ref:fn11">&uarr;</a> I will still take it
            one short at a time... I saw <i>Civic</i> the other day and did not log it, for
            example, since I don't think it left a proper impression on me to justify
            it. But <i>Black Panthers</i> did, so that I'll log... still unhappy about this
            lack of clear criteria though.
