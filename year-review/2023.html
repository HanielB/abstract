            <p>I love watching films, but I also love collecting data about my
            movie-watching and looking at it, computing fun things about it,
            etc. Here I'll summarize some of these things related to 2023 as
            well as look into the films I watched in 2023 that I loved the
            most. It's the first time I'm writing such a review and let's see
            how it goes.</p>
            
            <p>This has been a great year film-wise for me. This year there were
            many great movies released and I also saw many, many old great films
            for the first time. Also I never saw so many <i>filminhos</i> (just
            a few more than in 2017, the previous top year), and, specially,
            never saw so many in a movie theater (70!  Had never been more than
            40 before). I was also happy that I managed to write a bit my
            impressions about almost all the films I saw, a good indicator that
            I did not have long "outage" stretches where I did not have the
            energy to timely log and write about the films I was watching (there
            were a few, but I generally recovered in time to still write about
            them).</p>

            <h3>The Journey</h3>

            <p>The overview of my movie watching this year is summarized in the
              plot<a class="ref" id="ref:fn1" href="#fn:1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> below. The
            green bars are for films watched in a cinema.  In the X axis by the
            names of the months are the number of watched films in that month,
            with the max and min months in bold.</p>

            <br>
            <span><img src ="./2023.png"  class="img-responsive" style="width: 100%"/></span>
            <br>
            
            <p>I started strong in January (consistently a strong month for me)
              with 28 films (second-best only to January 2019, when I saw 33
              films<a class="ref" id="ref:fn2" href="#fn:2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>!)
              and kept a good average through April: about 3 movies/week after
              Jan, with the average sitting close to 4 by the end of
              April. Generally my goal is to see about 4 movies a week on
              average, so it was going great.</p>

            <p>Then came what I'll call the <i>DARPA months</i>, when at work
            (see my <a href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/">work page</a>) I was
            writing <i>two</i> project proposals in a call
            by <a href="">DARPA</a>, which was much more work than I anticipated
            and kinda took over my life, to great personal suffering, of which
            me watching only 9 films in <i>two months</i> is but a symptom (one
            of the proposals got through, at least!).</p>

            <p>I bounced back in July greatly helped<a class="ref" id="ref:fn3"
                                                       href="#fn:3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
              by a big sci-fi series ran by
              the <a href="https://fcs.mg.gov.br/espacos-culturais/palacio-das-artes/cine-humberto-mauro/">Cine
                Humberto Mauro</a> in Belo Horizonte, with a lot of old favorites of

              mine. I kept the momentum in early August helped by vacation and
              that continued as I went back to work, thanks to more free time
              for movies available due to my wife going abroad for the rest of
              the year and for three months without traveling for
              me<a class="ref" id="ref:fn4"
              href="#fn:4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. From July through November my
              weekly average was 5.22, my highest ever 5-month average!
            </p>

            <p>The year wrapped with a lot of travel and less movies watched, but
            I took advantage of a week home in mid-December to catch-up on films
            that were in theaters and an Ozu series going on at Cine Humberto
            Mauro. It's been wonderful.</p>

1.  <a class="fn" id="fn:1" href="#ref:fn1">&uarr;</a> The bars equate the number of movies watched in the respective week, and I define a week as starting on Mondays. Week 1 of 2023 is the week starting on the first day of 2023 that is a Monday. Thus, since 2023-01-01 was a Sunday, the plot has to include the last week of 2022, of which that Sunday was a part of. But only the films watched in the 2023 part of that week, i.e., on 2023-01-01, are represented in the plot. Week 1 starts on 2023-01-02, as expected.
<br>
2.  <a class="fn" id="fn:2" href="#ref:fn2">&uarr;</a> Probably thanks to an
              absolute awful winter that I spent alone in Iowa City, including a
              three-day period with -50Â°C!
<br>
3.  <a class="fn" id="fn:3" href="#ref:fn3">&uarr;</a> Besides the end of the DARPA
            crunch as well as the end of the teaching semester at UFMG.
<br>
4.  <a class="fn" id="fn:4" href="#ref:fn4">&uarr;</a> 2023 was a crazy year for me, traveling-wise. I spent 46 days away from home for work trips and 48 days in personal trips.
