            <br>

            <p>I love watching films, but I also love collecting data about my
            movie-watching and looking at it, computing fun things about it,
            etc. Here I'll summarize some of these things related to 2023 as
            well as look into the films I watched in 2023 that I loved the
            most. It's the first time I'm writing such a review and let's see
            how it goes.</p>
            
            <p>2023 has been a great year film-wise for me. There were many
            great movies released and I also saw many, many old great films for
            the first time. Also I never saw so many <i>filminhos</i> (just a
            few more than in 2017, the previous top year<a class="ref"
            id="ref:fn0" href="#fn:0"><sup>[0]</sup></a>), and, specially, never
            saw so many in a movie theater (70!  Had never been more than 40
            before). I was also happy that I managed to write a bit my
            impressions about almost all the films I saw, a good indicator that
            I did not have long "outage" stretches where I did not have the
            energy to timely log and write about the films I was watching (there
            were a few, but I generally recovered in time to still write about
            them).</p>

            <h3>The Journey</h3>

            <p>The overview of my movie watching in 2023 is summarized in the
              plot<a class="ref" id="ref:fn1" href="#fn:1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> below. The
            green bars are for films watched in a cinema.  In the X axis by the
            names of the months are the number of watched films in that month,
            with the max and min months in bold.</p>

            <br>
            <span><img src ="./2023.png"  class="img-responsive" style="width: 100%"/></span>
            <br>
            
            <p>I started strong in January (consistently a strong month for me)
              with 28 films (second-best only to January 2019, when I saw 33
              films<a class="ref" id="ref:fn2" href="#fn:2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>!)
              and kept a good average through April: about 3 movies/week after
              Jan, with the average sitting close to 4 by the end of
              April. Generally my goal is to see about 4 movies a week on
              average, so it was going great.</p>

            <p>Then came what I'll call the <i>DARPA months</i>, when at work
            (see my <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/">work page</a>) I was
            writing <i>two</i> project proposals in a call
            by <a target="_blank" href="">DARPA</a>, which was much more work than I anticipated
            and kinda took over my life, to great personal suffering, of which
            me watching only 9 films in <i>two months</i> is but a symptom (one
            of the proposals got through, at least!).</p>

            <p>I bounced back in July greatly helped<a class="ref" id="ref:fn3"
                                                       href="#fn:3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
              by a big sci-fi series ran by
              the <a target="_blank" href="https://fcs.mg.gov.br/espacos-culturais/palacio-das-artes/cine-humberto-mauro/">Cine
                Humberto Mauro</a> in Belo Horizonte, with a lot of old favorites of

              mine. I kept the momentum in early August helped by vacation and
              that continued as I went back to work, thanks to more free time
              for movies available due to my wife going abroad for the rest of
              the year and for three months without traveling for
              me<a class="ref" id="ref:fn4"
              href="#fn:4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. From July through November my
              weekly average was 5.22, my highest ever 5-month average!
            </p>

            <p>The year wrapped with a lot of travel and less movies watched, but
            I took advantage of a week home in mid-December to catch-up on films
            that were in theaters and an Ozu series going on at Cine Humberto
            Mauro. It's been wonderful.</p>

            <h3>Highlights</h3>

            <h4>Rewatching <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/sv94"><i>Drive my Car</i></a> and  <a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/iwtE"><i>Memoria</i></a></h4>

            This year I discovered a new cinema in Belo Horizonte (it opened
            midway through 2022 and I didn't know), which is part
            of <a target="_blank" href="https://minastenisclube.com.br/cultura/centro-cultural-unimed-bh-minas/">Centro
            Cultural Unimed-BH Minas</a> and has great (i.e., not like the
            mainstream-restricted cinemas in shopping malls) programming. Early
            in 2023 they did sort of a "best of 2022" series, which had my two
            favorites films from 2021: <i>Drive My Car</i> and <i>Memoria</i>,
            respectively.

            It was a delight to see them again in a movie theater and to get to
            know this new venue in BH. BTW these are all the movies I saw there
            this
            year: <a target="_blank" href="https://hanielbarbosa.com/filminhos/?watched=2023&tags=cinema;minas&header=Films_watched_at_Minas_cinema_in_2023">link</a>.

            <h4><a target="_blank" href="https://boxd.it/wUow">Oppenheimer</a> in 70mm</h4>

            First time I watched a film in 70mm! I had a work trip to Norway in
            July 

            Funnily enough, this was also the 100th film I watched in 2023. The
            only time I was faster to reach 100 watched films in a year was in
            2019 (a year in which I kept a 5 movie/week average through June
            before being totally derailed by traveling for work and moving
            countries).

            <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

            <ul>
            <li>One thing I tried in 2023 was to reduce the overwhelming
            dominance of US films in my movie watching. Historically it has been
            close to 70%! In 2023 it ended up being 58% (118/204), my lowest
            ever, so that was nice. On the other hand, I tried to up the
            percentage of Brazilian films and that basically failed, with only
            4.5% (9/204) of the total (which is sadly a record though).</li>

            <li>In 2023 I watched 24 films directed by women, another sad
              record. Something else to improve this year.</li>

            <li>I watched 9 films in planes, second to 10 in 2018. I never flew
            as much as in 2023, but that was also the year I got into movie
            podcasts and I listened to them a lot in flights, so that's probably
              why I didn't top 2018.</li>

            <li>I love the Criterion Channel with all my heart and in 2023 I was
            committed to watch more movies in it. That worked well, and I ended
            up watching 42 films (21% of my movie total), the previous maximum
            (the service started in 2020) being 28 in 2020 (20% of the total, in
              a slow year).

              I tried to lean more in their special series and I particularly
              liked their <i>'70s Car Movies</i> series. I like car
              movies<a class="ref" id="ref:fn5" href="#fn:5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
              and that series had sereval I did not previously know. There were
              some duds but overall it was quite fun.</li>

0. <a class="fn" id="fn:0" href="#ref:fn0">&uarr;</a> I started seriously collecting data on my movie watching in 2015, so that's when history starts.

1.  <a class="fn" id="fn:1" href="#ref:fn1">&uarr;</a> The bars equate the number of movies watched in the respective week, and I define a week as starting on Mondays. Week 1 of 2023 is the week starting on the first day of 2023 that is a Monday. Thus, since 2023-01-01 was a Sunday, the plot has to include the last week of 2022, of which that Sunday was a part of. But only the films watched in the 2023 part of that week, i.e., on 2023-01-01, are represented in the plot. Week 1 starts on 2023-01-02, as expected.
<br>
2.  <a class="fn" id="fn:2" href="#ref:fn2">&uarr;</a> Probably thanks to an
              absolute awful winter that I spent alone in Iowa City, including a
              three-day period with -50°C!
<br>
3.  <a class="fn" id="fn:3" href="#ref:fn3">&uarr;</a> Besides the end of the DARPA
            crunch as well as the end of the teaching semester at UFMG.
<br>
4.  <a class="fn" id="fn:4" href="#ref:fn4">&uarr;</a> 2023 was a crazy year for me, traveling-wise. I spent 46 days away from home for work trips and 48 days in personal trips.

<br>
5.  <a class="fn" id="fn:5" href="#ref:fn5">&uarr;</a> Letterboxd tells me the
most common "movie theme" for me in 2023
was <a target="_blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/hbarbosa/films/diary/for/2023/mini-theme/car-cars-racing-speed-adrenaline/by/date/">"Adrenaline-Fueled
  Action And Fast Cars"</a>, lol. Although only <i>Le Mans</i> is actually from the Criterion Channel series.
